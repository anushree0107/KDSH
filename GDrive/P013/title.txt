our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
 Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X.
Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functions
fa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb are
related, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or both
tasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or when
their domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compound
interpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical,
highly skewed dataset, compared to a robust single-task learning baseline. 2. Although our research
concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the
relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).

Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound
relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For
instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.
Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,
predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center
