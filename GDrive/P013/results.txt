the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.
Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"
"help"), "cognition" (e.g., "think," "believe," "know"), and "motion" (e.g.50% on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.
This indicates that our method treats items from different groups fairly, effectively alleviating the impact of popularity
bias. This success can be attributed to our re-weighted contrast module, which addresses representation separation from a
popularity-centric perspective, resulting in more consistent recommendation results across different groups.
3.5 Hyperparameter Sensitivities
In this section, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters in PAAC. Firstly, we investigate the influence of λ1andλ2, which
respectively control the impact of the popularity-aware supervised alignment and re-weighting contrast loss. Additionally, in the
79%, and 82.89% in NDCG@20 on the
Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book datasets, respectively. Compared to the strongest baselines, PAAC delivers better
performance. The most significant improvements are observed on Yelp2018, where our model achieves an 8.70% increase
in Recall@20, a 10.81% increase in HR@20, and a 30.2% increase in NDCG@20. This improvement can be attributed
to our use of popularity-aware supervised alignment to enhance the representation of less popular items and re-weighted
contrastive learning to address representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective.
