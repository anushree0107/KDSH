with
φ(ˆx) =SA(Φk(ˆx)WQ,Φk(ˆx)WK,Φk(ˆx)WV) (3)
where GRN (.)is the Gated Residual Network to integrate dual inputs into one integrated embedding, Norm (.)is a standard layer
normalization, SA(.)is a scaled dot-product self-attention, Φk(.For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating
SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited
keypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.
In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which
employs a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion

and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to
produce a dense point cloud.
During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline
order. For regularization, a normalization layer followed by a dropout layer is added after Equation 4.
Following the modality positional embedding layer in subsection 4.1, the positional embeddings of RSSI hr= [hr
1, ..., hr
T]and
accelerometer ha= [ha
1, ..., ha
T], produced by Eq. 1, are then fed to an MDCSA layer with various kernel sizes [k1, ..., k n]:
h=MDCSA k1,...,k n(hr, ha) (6)
to yield h= [h1, ..., h T]withht∈Rdandt < T .
