Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

Sample operators which have uniform concentration properties have been studied as restricted
isometries in the area of compressed sensing. For shallow ReLU networks of the form (1), we define
the restricted isometry property of the sampling operator Sas follows.

Generalization in ReLU Networks via Restricted
Isometry and Norm Concentration
Abstract
Regression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space,
are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func-
tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying a
model that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted Isometry
Property (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures all
shallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine the
sample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbers
of the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As-
