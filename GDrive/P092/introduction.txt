1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.Generalization in ReLU Networks via Restricted
Isometry and Norm Concentration
Abstract
Regression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space,
are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func-
tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying a
model that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted Isometry
Property (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures all
shallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine the
sample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbers
of the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As-
are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the modelâ€™s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
