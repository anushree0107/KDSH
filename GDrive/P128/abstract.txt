highly skewed dataset, compared to a robust single-task learning baseline. 2. Although our research
concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the
relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).

Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound
relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For
instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.
Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,
predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center
our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
Several recent studies have conducted extensive experiments on the application of TL and MTL to a
variety of NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, semantic labeling, sentence-level sentiment
classification, super-tagging, chunking, and semantic dependency parsing. The consensus among
these studies is that the advantages of TL and MTL are largely contingent on the characteristics of the
tasks involved, including the unevenness of the data distribution, the semantic relatedness between
the source and target tasks, the learning trajectory of the auxiliary and main tasks (where target tasks
that quickly reach a plateau benefit most from non-plateauing auxiliary tasks), and the structural
similarity between the tasks.
