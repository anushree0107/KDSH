PCEDT have distinctly high ratios compared to other relations in Figure 2. These relations also
have the second-highest F1 score in their datasets—except for STL on PCEDT (see Tables 4 and
5). Lexical memorization is therefore a likely cause of these high F1 scores. We also observed that
lower ratios of relation-specific constituents correlate with lower F1 scores, such as APP and REG in
PCEDT. Based on these insights, we can’t dismiss the possibility that our models show some degree
of lexical memorization, despite manual analysis also presenting cases where models demonstrate
generalization and correct predictions in situations where lexical memorization is impossible.
8 Conclusion
 Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X.
Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functions
fa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb are
related, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or both
tasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or when
their domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compound
interpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical,
The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
