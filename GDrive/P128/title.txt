observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
neural network configurations, except for the one using only predictions and justifications.
**Encoding Questions and Justifications** The neural network that only utilizes the prediction
to represent a forecast surpasses both baseline methods. Notably, integrating the question, the
justification, or both into the forecast representation yields further improvements. These results
indicate that incorporating the question and forecaster-provided justifications into the model enhances
the accuracy of question calling.
**Calling Questions Throughout Their Life** When examining the results across the four quartiles of
a question’s duration, it’s observed that while using active forecasts is beneficial across all quartiles
for both baselines and all network configurations, the neural networks surprisingly outperform the
 Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of
each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.

Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:

the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the
