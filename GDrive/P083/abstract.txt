 This method refined the uniformity of representations and successfully reduced separation. We
validated our method, PAAC, on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and underlying rationale.
In the future, we will explore deeper alignment and contrast adjustments tailored to specific tasks to further mitigate popularity
bias. We aim to investigate the synergies between alignment and contrast and extend our approach to address other biases in
recommendation systems.

The bounds on the sample complexity for achieving the NeuRIPs event, from Theorem 1, are proven
by applying these Lemmata.
this task is influenced by factors such as the label set used and its distribution. For the experiments
detailed in this paper, we utilize a noun-noun compounds dataset that features compounds annotated
with two distinct taxonomies of relations. This means that each noun-noun compound is associated
with two different relations, each based on different linguistic theories. This dataset is derived from
established linguistic resources, including NomBank and the Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT). We chose this dataset for two primary reasons: firstly, the dual annotation of
relations on the same set of compounds is ideal for exploring TL and MTL approaches; secondly,
