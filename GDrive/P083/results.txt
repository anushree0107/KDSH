 This method refined the uniformity of representations and successfully reduced separation. We
validated our method, PAAC, on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and underlying rationale.
In the future, we will explore deeper alignment and contrast adjustments tailored to specific tasks to further mitigate popularity
bias. We aim to investigate the synergies between alignment and contrast and extend our approach to address other biases in
recommendation systems.

3 Experiments
In this section, we assess the efficacy of PAAC through comprehensive experiments, aiming to address the following research
questions:
• How does PAAC compare to existing debiasing methods?
• How do different designed components play roles in our proposed PAAC?
3
• How does PAAC alleviate the popularity bias?
• How do different hyper-parameters affect the PAAC recommendation performance?
3.1 Experiments Settings
3.1.1 Datasets
In our experiments, we use three widely public datasets: Amazon-book, Yelp2018, and Gowalla. We retained users and items with a
minimum of 10 interactions.
3.1.2 Baselines and Evaluation Metrics
It could be argued that all the localization models compared in Table 1 might not be statistically different due to the fairly high
standard deviation across all types of cross-validations, which is caused by the relatively small number of participants. In order to
compare multiple models over cross-validation sets and show the statistical significance of our proposed model, we perform the
Friedman test to first reject the null hypothesis. We then performed a pairwise statistical comparison: the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
with Holm’s alpha correction.
