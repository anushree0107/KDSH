1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.InceptionV3 5.3 mph

6.2.3 Pitch Type Classification
We conducted experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting pitch types from video, a task
made challenging by pitchersâ€™ efforts to disguise their pitches from batters and the subtle differences
between pitches, such as grip and rotation. We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose,
utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN.
Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Our
dataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7.Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models: A Quantitative Analysis
Abstract
Deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, are a significant family within deep learning. This study
provides a precise upper limit for the Wasserstein distance between a learned distribution by a diffusion model
and the target distribution. In contrast to earlier research, this analysis does not rely on presumptions regarding
the learned score function. Furthermore, the findings are applicable to any data-generating distributions within
restricted instance spaces, even those lacking a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and the upper limit is not
exponentially dependent on the ambient space dimension. The primary finding expands upon recent research by
