1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples. Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of
each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.
4.3 Architecture Ablation
Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:

6.2.3 Pitch Type Classification
We conducted experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting pitch types from video, a task
made challenging by pitchersâ€™ efforts to disguise their pitches from batters and the subtle differences
between pitches, such as grip and rotation. We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose,
utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN.
Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Our
dataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7.
