 We prove this property in a network
recovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These results
ensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a small
empirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achieving
NeuRIPs in Section V , by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results are
summarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions.
2 Notation and Assumptions
In this section, we will define the key notations and assumptions for the neural networks examined
in this study.The latter is an upper bound on the empirical risk, which real-world optimization algorithms can be
expected to achieve.
5 Size Control of Stochastic Processes on Shallow Networks
In this section, we introduce the key techniques for deriving concentration statements for the em-
pirical norm, uniformly valid for sets of shallow ReLU networks. We begin by rewriting the event
NeuRIPs(  ̄P) by treating μas a stochastic process, indexed by the parameter set  ̄P. The event
NeuRIPs(  ̄P) holds if and only if we have
sup
 Conversely, SGMs
employ score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating new
samples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varying
noise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the score
function for all noise levels has been proposed.
Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the score
function, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) has been derived.
