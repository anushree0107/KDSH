Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.

 We prove this property in a network
recovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These results
ensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a small
empirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achieving
NeuRIPs in Section V , by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results are
summarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions.
2 Notation and Assumptions
In this section, we will define the key notations and assumptions for the neural networks examined
in this study. Furthermore, we introduce a modified
version of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problemâ€™s
specific parameters.
1 Introduction
The recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,
have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,
adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed
that generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization
component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in
certain cases.
