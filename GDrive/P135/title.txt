 establish a new convergence rate of O(1/k), measured by the squared operator norm, for a modified version of OGDA,
which we call OGDA+. This rate matches that of EG and builds upon the recently introduced concept of weak solutions to
the Minty variational inequality.
2.Even when a stronger condition is imposed, specifically that the operator is also monotone, we enhance the range of feasible
step sizes for OGDA+ and obtain the most favorable result known for the standard method ( γ= 1).
3. We demonstrate a complexity bound of O(ε−2)for a stochastic variant of the OGDA+ method.
4.We also introduce an adaptive step size version of EG+.A specific subset of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was analyzed, and it was found that the extragradient method (EG)
exhibited favorable convergence behavior in experimental settings. Surprisingly, these problems did not appear to possess any of
the recognized favorable characteristics, such as monotonicity or Minty solutions. Subsequently, a suitable concept was identified
(see Assumption 1), which is less restrictive than the presence of a Minty solution (a condition frequently employed in the existing
literature) and also extends the idea of negative comonotonicity. Because of these properties that unify and generalize, the concept of
weak Minty solutions was quickly investigated.
Assumption 1 (Weak Minty solution).Addressing Min-Max Challenges in Nonconvex-Nonconcave Problems
with Solutions Exhibiting Weak Minty Properties
Abstract
This research examines a specific category of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems that demon-
strate a characteristic known as weak Minty solutions. This concept, which has only recently been defined, has
already demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.
We establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within
this framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared
operator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG).
