 Furthermore, we introduce a modified
version of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problemâ€™s
specific parameters.
1 Introduction
The recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,
have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,
adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed
that generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization
component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in
certain cases.
Addressing Min-Max Challenges in Nonconvex-Nonconcave Problems
with Solutions Exhibiting Weak Minty Properties
Abstract
This research examines a specific category of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems that demon-
strate a characteristic known as weak Minty solutions. This concept, which has only recently been defined, has
already demonstrated its effectiveness by encompassing various generalizations of monotonicity at the same time.
We establish new convergence findings for an enhanced variant of the optimistic gradient method (OGDA) within
this framework, achieving a convergence rate of 1/k for the most effective iteration, measured by the squared
operator norm, a result that aligns with the extragradient method (EG). We prove this property in a network
recovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These results
ensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a small
empirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achieving
NeuRIPs in Section V , by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results are
summarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions.
