an activity, eliminating the need for the model to identify the start and end of activities. Our methods
are based on a CNN that generates a per-frame or per-segment representation, derived from standard
two-stream CNNs using deep CNNs like I3D or InceptionV3.
Given video features vof dimensions T×D, where Trepresents the video’s temporal length and D
is the feature’s dimensionality, the usual approach for feature pooling involves max- or mean-pooling
across the temporal dimension, followed by a fully-connected layer for video clip classification, as
depicted in Fig. 5(a). This approach, however, yields a single representation for the entire video,
losing temporal information. The focus of more
recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical
flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been
developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets
such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.
Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity
recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-
.
Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. It
Mbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental.
1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.
