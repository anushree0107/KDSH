 The focus of more
recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical
flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been
developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets
such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.
Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity
recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-
.
Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. It
 An alternative is to employ a fixed temporal pyramid with various
lengths, as shown in Fig 5(b), dividing the video into intervals of lengths 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8, and
max-pooling each. The pooled features are concatenated, creating a K×Drepresentation, where K
is the number of intervals in the temporal pyramid, and a fully-connected layer classifies the clip.
We also explore learning temporal convolution filters to aggregate local temporal structures. A kernel
of size L×1is applied to each frame, enabling each timestep representation to incorporate information
from adjacent frames. After applying max-pooling to the output of the temporal convolution, a fully-
 We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
