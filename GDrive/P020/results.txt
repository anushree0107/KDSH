6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle
6.1 Methodology
To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as
depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-
motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,
a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh
quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to
facilitate model generation.
6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction
 For overall method performance, Table 4 shows
the MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics.
Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge dataset
are shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and color
adjustment across different scene parts.
Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work:
•Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentation
prompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency.
•Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including food
masks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increase
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.
