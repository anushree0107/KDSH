would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart home’s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
 The "majority vote" baseline determines the answer to a
question based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The "weighted vote" baseline,
on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them.
4.2 Neural Network Architecture
A neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generate
a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM
to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question.
The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256
neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenating
neural network configurations, except for the one using only predictions and justifications.
**Encoding Questions and Justifications** The neural network that only utilizes the prediction
to represent a forecast surpasses both baseline methods. Notably, integrating the question, the
justification, or both into the forecast representation yields further improvements. These results
indicate that incorporating the question and forecaster-provided justifications into the model enhances
the accuracy of question calling.
**Calling Questions Throughout Their Life** When examining the results across the four quartiles of
a question’s duration, it’s observed that while using active forecasts is beneficial across all quartiles
for both baselines and all network configurations, the neural networks surprisingly outperform the
