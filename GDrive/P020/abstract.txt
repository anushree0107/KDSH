Generalization in ReLU Networks via Restricted
Isometry and Norm Concentration
Abstract
Regression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space,
are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func-
tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying a
model that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted Isometry
Property (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures all
shallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine the
sample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbers
of the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As-
Finally, to demonstrate the benefits of TL and MTL for NomBank and PCEDT, we report the F1
macro-average scores in Table 8. This is arguably the appropriate evaluation measure for imbalanced
classification problems. Note that relations not predicted by any model are excluded from the macro-
average calculation. Table 8 clearly shows that TL and MTL on the embedding layer yield significant
improvements for PCEDT, with about a 7-8 point increase in macro-average F1, compared to just
0.65 in the best case for NomBank.

7.3 Generalization on Unseen Compounds
We now analyze the models’ ability to generalize to compounds not seen during training. Recent
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
