Table 5 shows the average precision for each activity class. Learning temporal structure is particularly
beneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information

compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detecting
 We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
