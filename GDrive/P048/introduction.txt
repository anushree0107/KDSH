 Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of
each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.
4.3 Architecture Ablation
Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:

* Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction and
the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the
 They then projected the 3D
object back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.
6.2 Experimental Results
Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that
minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization
aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion
of this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects
amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
