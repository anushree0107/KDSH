Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

4.2.2 VolETA Results
The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results
 For overall method performance, Table 4 shows
the MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics.
Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge dataset
are shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and color
adjustment across different scene parts.
Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work:
•Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentation
prompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency.
•Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including food
masks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increase
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
