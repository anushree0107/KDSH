approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,
and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D
reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting
to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,
and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the
organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and

develop more accurate, user-friendly, and widely applicable food portion estimation techniques,
impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.
3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline
3.1 Dataset Description
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.

 This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.
To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR
i}n
i=1, and
food object masks {MF
i}n
i=1. This step, denoted as {IR
i}n
i=1, integrates various data sources into a
unified format for further processing.
The team converts the RGBA images {IR
i}n
i=1and camera poses {Cj}k
j=1into meaningful metadata
and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.
The modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes
