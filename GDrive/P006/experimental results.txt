the full ranking strategy, considering all non-interacted items as candidate items to avoid selection bias during the test stage. We
repeated each experiment five times with different random seeds and reported the average scores.
3.2 Overall Performance
As shown in Table 1, we compare our model with several baselines across three datasets. The best performance for each metric
is highlighted in bold, while the second best is underlined. Our model consistently outperforms all compared methods across all
metrics in every dataset.
•Our proposed model PAAC consistently outperforms all baselines and significantly mitigates the popularity bias. Specif-
ically, PAAC enhances LightGCN, achieving improvements of 282.65%, 180.The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
Table 1: MetaFood Challenge Data Details
Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.
