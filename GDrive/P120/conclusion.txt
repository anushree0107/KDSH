improve its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations.
1 Introduction
Noun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between two
nouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound "street protest,"
the task is to identify the semantic relationship between "street" and "protest," which is a locative
relation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and its
significance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and information
retrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.

Table 2 presents a fundamental analysis of the 96,664 forecast justifications in the dataset. The median
length is relatively short, consisting of one sentence and 23 tokens. Justifications mention named
entities less frequently than the questions themselves. Interestingly, half of the justifications contain
at least one negation, and 25% include three or more. This suggests that forecasters sometimes base
semantic dependency parsing in PCEDT and NomBank. Future research will focus on incorporating
additional natural language processing tasks defined using these frameworks to understand noun-noun
compound interpretation using TL and MTL.
