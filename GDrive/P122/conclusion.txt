would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart home’s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
However, none of these prior works have specifically aimed to call questions throughout their entire
duration.

3 Dataset
The research utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, and
individuals submit their forecasts. The questions primarily revolve around geopolitics, encompassing
areas such as domestic and international politics, the economy, and social matters. For this study, all
binary questions were collected, along with their associated forecasts, each comprising a prediction
and a justification. In total, the dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submitted
over 32,708 days. This dataset significantly expands upon previous research, nearly doubling the
number of forecasts analyzed.34 23.98
