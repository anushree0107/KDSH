surfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects.
The competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing
numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc-
tion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy
through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance
metric.
Of all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative
solutions. Team V olETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and
Phase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team

object back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.
6.2 Experimental Results
Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that
minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization
aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion
of this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects
amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for
