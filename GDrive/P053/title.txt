 However, in the presence of weak Minty solutions, there is additional interest in
choosing large step sizes. We observed in Theorem 3.1 and related works the fact that a crucial ingredient in the analysis is that the
step size is chosen larger than a multiple of the weak Minty parameter œÅto guarantee convergence at all. For these reasons, we want
to outline a method using adaptive step sizes, meaning that no step size needs to be supplied by the user and no line-search is carried
out.
Since the analysis of OGDA+ is already quite involved in the constant step size regime, we choose to equip EG+ with an adaptive

C.1 Safeability Constraints
The "safeability" property, originally introduced and used to verify the safety of the VerticalCAS
neural networks can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The "safeable region" for
a given advisory represents input locations where that advisory can be selected such that future
advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is "unsafeable"
and the corresponding input region is the "unsafeable region". Examples of these regions, and their
proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory.
 It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,
termed "weak Minty," without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.
Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as
the update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the
length of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is
