surfaces, and intricate geometries common in culinary subjects.
The competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing
numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc-
tion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy
through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance
metric.
Of all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative
solutions. Team V olETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and
Phase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team

dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
