our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
improve its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations.
1 Introduction
Noun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between two
nouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound "street protest,"
the task is to identify the semantic relationship between "street" and "protest," which is a locative
relation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and its
significance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and information
retrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.
