represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide
insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house
where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows
the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living
room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across
all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e.provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an ox’s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.
In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from
We have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, available
on YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videos
intended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. The
dataset’s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where a
single camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variance
in motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. In
contrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activities
with diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single frame
