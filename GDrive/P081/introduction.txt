applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every

where Ipop∈IBandIunpop∈IBare disjoint, with Ipopconsisting of the top x%of items in the batch. In this work, we dynamically
divided items into popular and unpopular groups within each mini-batch based on their popularity, assigning the top 50% as popular
items and the bottom 50% as unpopular items. This radio not only ensures equal representation of both groups in our contrastive
learning but also allows items to be classified adaptively based on the batch’s current composition.
