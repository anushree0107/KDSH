several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete
list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every
Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions
and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,
empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current studyâ€™s focus,
researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within
online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including
within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.
The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,
without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.
Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-
tation.improve its F1 scores for less common yet more challenging semantic relations.
1 Introduction
Noun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between two
nouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound "street protest,"
the task is to identify the semantic relationship between "street" and "protest," which is a locative
relation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and its
significance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and information
retrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.
