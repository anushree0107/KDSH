Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions
and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,
empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current studyâ€™s focus,
researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within
online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including
within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.
The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,
without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.
Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-
tation.several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete
list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every
 Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X.
Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functions
fa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb are
related, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or both
tasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or when
their domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compound
interpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical,
