several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete
list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every
note that this does not necessarily imply that we aim to use a single model to predict both label sets
in practice.
5 Neural Classification Models
This section introduces the neural classification models utilized in our experiments. To discern the
impact of TL and MTL, we initially present a single-task learning model, which acts as our baseline.
Subsequently, we employ this same model to implement TL and MTL.
5.1 Single-Task Learning Model
In our single-task learning (STL) configuration, we train and fine-tune a feed-forward neural network
inspired by the neural classifier proposed by Dima and Hinrichs (2015). This network comprises four
in the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especially
since the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks.
4 Transfer vs. Multi-Task Learning
In this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) to
articulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be described
in terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the input
feature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task is
defined by X, P(X).
