several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete
list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every
50% on the Gowalla and Yelp2018 datasets, respectively.
This indicates that our method treats items from different groups fairly, effectively alleviating the impact of popularity
bias. This success can be attributed to our re-weighted contrast module, which addresses representation separation from a
popularity-centric perspective, resulting in more consistent recommendation results across different groups.
3.5 Hyperparameter Sensitivities
In this section, we analyze the impact of hyperparameters in PAAC. Firstly, we investigate the influence of λ1andλ2, which
respectively control the impact of the popularity-aware supervised alignment and re-weighting contrast loss. Additionally, in the
our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
