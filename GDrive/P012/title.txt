One should notice that, in Theorem 1, there is a tradeoff between the parameter s, which limits the
deviation |∥ · ∥ m− ∥ · ∥ μ|, and the confidence parameter u. The lower bound on the corresponding
sample size mis split into two scaling regimes when understanding the quotient uof|∥·∥m−∥·∥ μ|/s
as a precision parameter. While in the regime of low deviations and high probabilities the sample size
mmust scale quadratically with u/s, in the regime of less precise statements one observes a linear
scaling.

It could be argued that all the localization models compared in Table 1 might not be statistically different due to the fairly high
standard deviation across all types of cross-validations, which is caused by the relatively small number of participants. In order to
compare multiple models over cross-validation sets and show the statistical significance of our proposed model, we perform the
Friedman test to first reject the null hypothesis. We then performed a pairwise statistical comparison: the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
with Holm’s alpha correction.
