PCEDT have distinctly high ratios compared to other relations in Figure 2. These relations also
have the second-highest F1 score in their datasets—except for STL on PCEDT (see Tables 4 and
5). Lexical memorization is therefore a likely cause of these high F1 scores. We also observed that
lower ratios of relation-specific constituents correlate with lower F1 scores, such as APP and REG in
PCEDT. Based on these insights, we can’t dismiss the possibility that our models show some degree
of lexical memorization, despite manual analysis also presenting cases where models demonstrate
generalization and correct predictions in situations where lexical memorization is impossible.
8 Conclusion
The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
assumptions about the data distribution or the learned score function, and with simple proofs that do not need the SDE toolkit.
Furthermore, the bounds presented here do not involve any complex discretization steps, as the forward and backward processes are
considered discrete-time from the beginning, rather than being viewed as discretizations of continuous-time processes.

There has been an increasing amount of research aimed at providing theoretical findings on the convergence of SGMs. However,
these studies frequently depend on restrictive assumptions regarding the data-generating distribution, produce non-quantitative upper
bounds, or exhibit exponential dependencies on certain parameters. This work successfully circumvents all three of these limitations.
