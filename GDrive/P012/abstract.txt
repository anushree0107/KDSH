re-weighting contrastive loss, we introduce two hyperparameters, αandβ, to control the re-weighting of different popularity items
as positive and negative samples. Finally, we explore the impact of the grouping ratio xon the model’s performance.
3.5.1 Effect of λ1andλ2
As formulated in Eq. (11), λ1controls the extent of providing additional supervisory signals for unpopular items, while λ2controls
the extent of optimizing representation consistency. Horizontally, with the increase in λ2, the performance initially increases and
then decreases. This indicates that appropriate re-weighting contrastive loss effectively enhances the consistency of representation
distributions, mitigating popularity bias.assumptions about the data distribution or the learned score function, and with simple proofs that do not need the SDE toolkit.
Furthermore, the bounds presented here do not involve any complex discretization steps, as the forward and backward processes are
considered discrete-time from the beginning, rather than being viewed as discretizations of continuous-time processes.

There has been an increasing amount of research aimed at providing theoretical findings on the convergence of SGMs. However,
these studies frequently depend on restrictive assumptions regarding the data-generating distribution, produce non-quantitative upper
bounds, or exhibit exponential dependencies on certain parameters. This work successfully circumvents all three of these limitations.
The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
