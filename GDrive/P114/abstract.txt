1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples. However, because unpopular items have
limited interactions, they are usually modeled based on a small group of users. This limited focus can result in overfitting, as the
representations of unpopular items might not fully capture their features.
The disparity in the quantity of supervisory signals is essential for learning representations of both popular and unpopular items.
Specifically, popular items gain from a wealth of supervisory signals during the alignment process, which helps in effectively
learning their representations. On the other hand, unpopular items, which have a limited number of users providing supervision, are
more susceptible to overfitting. This is because there is insufficient representation learning for unpopular items, emphasizing the
effect of supervisory signal distribution on the quality of representation.applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.
