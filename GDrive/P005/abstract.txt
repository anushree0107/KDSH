7 Conclusion
This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel and challenging dataset designed for detailed activity
recognition in videos. We conduct a comparative analysis of various recognition techniques that
employ temporal feature pooling for both segmented and continuous videos. Our findings reveal that
learning sub-events to pinpoint temporal regions of interest significantly enhances performance in
segmented video classification. In the context of activity detection in continuous videos, we establish
PixSfM, which involves extracting features using SuperPoint, matching them with SuperGlue, and
refining them. The outputs are the camera poses {Cj}k
j=1, crucial for understanding the sceneâ€™s
spatial layout.

In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments
the reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask MRfor each
keyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method
extends the reference object mask MRto all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object
masks {MR

i=1.This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi-
ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition or
detection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activities
are often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scene
structure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. This
study compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities in
segmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams.
