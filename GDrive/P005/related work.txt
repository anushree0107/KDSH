approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,
and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D
reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting
to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,
and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the
organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and

Advancements in 3D Food Modeling: A Review of the
MetaFood Challenge Techniques and Outcomes
Abstract
The growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri-
tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods
for food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited
collaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly
hindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by
introducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically
accurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-
ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels
portion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional
investigations.
Conventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires
(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be
burdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-
based methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing
3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment
tools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly
impact nutrition science and public health.
