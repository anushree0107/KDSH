 Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.
4.3 Architecture Ablation
Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:

* Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction and
the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the
