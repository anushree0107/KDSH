 - A modified transformer
encoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforce
dependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoder
to learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacing
the context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposed

6.2.3 Pitch Type Classification
We conducted experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting pitch types from video, a task
made challenging by pitchersâ€™ efforts to disguise their pitches from batters and the subtle differences
between pitches, such as grip and rotation. We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose,
utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN.
Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Our
dataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7.Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
