The competition involved 20 diverse food items, captured under various conditions and with differing
numbers of input images, specifically designed to challenge participants in creating robust reconstruc-
tion models. The evaluation was based on a two-phase process, assessing both portion size accuracy
through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and shape accuracy using the Chamfer distance
metric.
Of all participating teams, three reached the final submission stage, presenting a range of innovative
solutions. Team V olETA secured first place with the best overall performance in both Phase-I and
Phase-II, followed by team ININ-VIAUN in second place. Additionally, the FoodRiddle team
 Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.
