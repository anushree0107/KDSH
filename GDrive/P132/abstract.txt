The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.

 Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

with ground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. The team’s approach was
applied separately to each food scene. A one-shot food volume estimation approach was used if
the number of keyframes kequaled 1; otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation was applied.
Notably, the keyframe selection process chose 34.8% of the total frames for the rest of the pipeline,
showing the minimum frames with the highest information.
