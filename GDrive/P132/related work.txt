Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.

of complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A
total of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies
developed during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in
3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in
dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop

1 Introduction
The convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative
approaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge
represents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise
and scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such
