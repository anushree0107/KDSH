Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"

1 Introduction
Noun-noun compound interpretation involves determining the semantic connection between two
nouns (or noun phrases in multi-word compounds). For instance, in the compound "street protest,"
the task is to identify the semantic relationship between "street" and "protest," which is a locative
relation in this example. Given the prevalence of noun-noun compounds in natural language and its
significance to other natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question answering and information
retrieval, understanding noun-noun compounds has been extensively studied in theoretical linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and computational linguistics.
 For instance, the temporal and locative relations in
NomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC, respectively) and their PCEDT counterparts (TWHEN
and LOC) exhibit relatively consistent behavior across frameworks, as they annotate many of the
same compounds. However, some relations that are theoretically similar do not align well in practice.
For example, the functor AIM in PCEDT and the modifier argument ARGM-PNC in NomBank
express a somewhat related semantic concept (purpose), but there is minimal overlap between the
sets of compounds they annotate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the semantic similarity
