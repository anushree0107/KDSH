The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
as shown in Table 2. We do not apply TL (or MTL) to the output layer because it is task- or
dataset-specific.
5.3 Multi-Task Learning Models
In MTL, we train a single model to simultaneously learn both PCEDT and NomBank relations,
meaning all MTL models have two objective functions and two output layers. We implement two
MTL setups: MTLE, which features a shared embedding layer but two task-specific hidden layers,
and MTLF, which has no task-specific layers aside from the output layer (i.e., both the embedding
and hidden layers are shared). We distinguish between the auxiliary and main tasks based on which
on noun-noun compound interpretation through the application of transfer and multi-task learning.
The application of transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL) in NLP has gained significant
attention in recent years, yielding varying outcomes based on the specific tasks, model architectures,
and datasets involved. These varying results, combined with the fact that neither TL nor MTL has
been previously applied to noun-noun compound interpretation, motivate our thorough empirical
investigation into the use of TL and MTL for this task. Our aim is not only to add to the existing
research on the effectiveness of TL and MTL for semantic NLP tasks generally but also to ascertain
their specific advantages for compound interpretation.
