Obthus represents the overlap regions for each combination of
input constraints. For example, O101is the set of points in A1andA3, but not in A2, and O0...0is
the set where no input constraints apply. We also define Oas the set of bit strings, b, such that Ob
is non-empty, and define k=|O|. The sets {Ob:b∈O}create a partition of Xaccording to the
combination of input constraints that apply.
Given:
•c different input constraint proximity functions, σi:X→[0,1], where σiis continuous and
∀x∈Ai,σi(x) = 0 ,
In practice, large batch sizes of order O(ε−1)are typically not desirable; instead, a small or decreasing step size is preferred. In the
weak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,
the current analysis does not allow for variable γ.
4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes
In this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the
Lipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to
small step sizes and slow convergence behavior.
