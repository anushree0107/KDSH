connected layer is used for classification, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c).
While temporal pyramid pooling retains some structure, the intervals are fixed and predetermined.
Previous studies have shown that learning the sub-interval to pool is beneficial for activity recognition.
These learned intervals are defined by three parameters: a center g, a width σ, and a stride δ,
parameterizing NGaussians. Given the video length T, the positions of the strided Gaussians are
first calculated as:

was computed and clipped to [−20,20]. For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames
(8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in
3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adam
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50
epochs.
