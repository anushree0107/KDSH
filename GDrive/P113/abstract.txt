Safe Predictors for Input-Output Specification
Enforcement
Abstract
This paper presents an approach for designing neural networks, along with other
machine learning models, which adhere to a collection of input-output specifica-
tions. Our method involves the construction of a constrained predictor for each set
of compatible constraints, and combining these predictors in a safe manner using a
convex combination of their predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of this
method with synthetic datasets and on an aircraft collision avoidance problem.
1 Introduction
The increasing adoption of machine learning models, such as neural networks, in safety-critical
applications, such as autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance, highlights an urgent
need for the development of guarantees on safety and robustness.When used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1, these values help ensure safety.
Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for the
CL1500 advisory.
C.3 Structure of Predictors
The compressed versions of the policy tables from prior work are neural networks with six hidden
layers, 45 dimensions in each layer, and ReLU activation functions. We use the same architecture
for our standard, unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture.
However, the first four hidden layers are shared between all of the predictors. This learns a single,
shared input space representation, and also allows each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each
the specifications until after training. Our work seeks to design networks with enforced input-output
constraints even before training has been completed. This will allow for online learning scenarios
where a system has to guarantee safety throughout its operation.
This paper presents an approach for designing a safe predictor (a neural network or any other
machine learning model) that will always meet a set of constraints on the input-output relationship.
This assumes that the constrained output regions can be formulated to be convex. Our correct-
by-construction safe predictor is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints, even before training, and at
every training step. We describe our approach in Section 2, and show its use in an aircraft collision
avoidance problem in Section 3.
