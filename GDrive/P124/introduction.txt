 The central problem addressed in
this work is termed "calling a question," which refers to the process of determining a final prediction
by aggregating individual forecasts. Two strategies are employed for calling questions each day
throughout their life: considering forecasts submitted on the given day ("daily") and considering the
last forecast submitted by each forecaster ("active").
Inspired by prior research on recognizing and fostering skilled forecasters, and analyzing written
justifications to assess the quality of individual or collective forecasts, this paper investigates the
automated calling of questions throughout their duration based on the forecasts available each day.
The primary contributions are empirical findings that address the following research questions:
explanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be considered
weaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources.
To clarify the terminology used: a "question" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,
"Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?"). Questions have a defined start and
end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the "life" of the question. "Forecasters"
are individuals who provide a "forecast," which consists of a "prediction" and a "justification." The
prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification
is the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction.* When making a prediction on a specific day, is it advantageous to include forecasts from previous
days? (Yes) * Does the accuracy of the prediction improve when considering the question itself
and the written justifications provided with the forecasts? (Yes) * Is it easier to make an accurate
prediction toward the end of a question’s duration? (Yes) * Are written justifications more valuable
when the crowd’s predictions are less accurate? (Yes)
In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with both accurate
and inaccurate forecasts. This analysis aims to identify the features that contribute to a justification
being more or less credible.
