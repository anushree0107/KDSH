While PD symptoms, including gait and balance parameters, can be measured continuously at home using wearable devices
containing inertial motor units (IMUs) or smartphones, this data does not show the context in which the measurements are taken.
Determining a person’s location within a home (indoor localization) could provide valuable contextual information for interpreting
PD symptoms. For instance, symptoms like freezing of gait and turning in gait vary depending on the environment, so knowing a
person’s location could help predict such symptoms or interpret their severity. Additionally, understanding how much time someone
spends alone or with others in a room is a step towards understanding their social participation, which impacts quality of life in
PD.However, as the disease advances, a significant portion of patients begin to experience "wearing off" of their medication before
the next scheduled dose, resulting in the reappearance of parkinsonian symptoms, such as slowed gait. These fluctuations in
symptoms negatively impact patients’ quality of life and often necessitate adjustments to their medication regimen. The severity
of motor symptoms can escalate to the point where they impede an individual’s ability to walk and move within their own home.
Consequently, individuals may be inclined to remain confined to a single room, and when they do move, they may require more time
to transition between rooms. These observations could potentially be used to identify periods when PD patients are experiencing
represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide
insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house
where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows
the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living
room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across
all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e.
