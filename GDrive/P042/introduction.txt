 Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

metric. Given two point sets XandY, the Chamfer distance is defined as:
dCD(X, Y ) =1
|X|X
x∈Xmin
y∈Y∥x−y∥2
2+1
|Y|X
y∈Ymin
x∈X∥x−y∥2

This metric offers a comprehensive measure of similarity between the reconstructed 3D models and
the ground truth. The final ranking is determined by combining scores from both Phase-I (volume
accuracy) and Phase-II (shape accuracy). Note that after the Phase-I evaluation, quality issues were
 For overall method performance, Table 4 shows
the MAPE and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics.
Additionally, qualitative results on one- and few-shot 3D reconstruction from the challenge dataset
are shown. The model excels in texture details, artifact correction, missing data handling, and color
adjustment across different scene parts.
Limitations: Despite promising results, several limitations need to be addressed in future work:
•Manual processes: The current pipeline includes manual steps like providing segmentation
prompts and identifying scaling factors, which should be automated to enhance efficiency.
•Input requirements: The method requires extensive input information, including food
masks and depth data. Streamlining these inputs would simplify the process and increase
