 Secondly, all TL models achieve improved accuracy on the NomBank test
split, although transfer learning does not significantly enhance accuracy on the development split of
the same dataset. The MTL models, especially MTLF, have a detrimental effect on the development
accuracy of NomBank, yet we observe a similar improvement, as with TL, on the test split. Thirdly,
both TL and MTL models demonstrate less consistent effects on PCEDT (on both development and
test splits) compared to NomBank. For instance, all TL models yield an absolute improvement of

about 1.25 points in accuracy on NomBank, whereas in PCEDT, TLE clearly outperforms the other
 Firstly, the MTLF model appears to be
detrimental to both datasets, leading to significantly degraded F1 scores for four NomBank relations,
including the locative modifier ARGM-LOC and the manner modifier ARGM-MNR (abbreviated as
LOC and MNR in Table 4), which the model fails to predict altogether. This same model exhibits
the lowest F1 score compared to all other models for two PCEDT relations: REG (expressing a
circumstance) and PAT (patient). Considering that the MTLF model achieves the highest accuracy
on the NomBank test split (as shown in Table 3), it becomes even more apparent that relying solely
validation accuracy (NomBank’s or PCEDT’s) is monitored by the early stopping criterion. This
leads to a total of four MTL models, as shown in Table 3.
6 Experimental Results
Tables 2 and 3 display the accuracies of the various TL and MTL models on the development and test
splits for NomBank and PCEDT. The top row in both tables indicates the accuracy of the STL model.
All models were trained solely on the training split. Several insights can be gleaned from these
tables. Firstly, the accuracy of the STL models decreases when evaluated on the test split for both
NomBank and PCEDT.
