undertake scripted activities such as moving from room to room) to fully validate the performance of our approach in other settings.
6 Conclusion
We have presented the MDCSA model, a new deep learning approach for indoor localization utilizing RSSI and wrist-worn
accelerometer data. The evaluation on our unique real-world free-living pilot dataset, which includes subjects with and without PD,
shows that MDCSA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for indoor localization. The availability of accelerometer data does indeed
enrich the RSSI features, which, in turn, improves the accuracy of indoor localization.
Accurate room localization using these data modalities has a wide range of potential applications within healthcare. This could

In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments
the reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask MRfor each
keyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method
extends the reference object mask MRto all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object
masks {MR
