Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.

parameter search for the number of trees (200, 250), the minimum number of samples in a leaf node (1, 5), and whether a warm start
is needed. The Gini impurity is used to measure splits.
**Evaluation Metrics:** We are interested in developing a system to monitor PD motor symptoms in home environments. For
example, we will consider if there is any significant difference in the performance of the system when it is trained with PD data
compared to being trained with healthy control (HC) data. We tailored our training procedure to test our hypothesis by performing
variations of cross-validation. Apart from training our models on all HC subjects (ALL-HC), we also perform four different kinds of
We define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize the
parameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss
function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from
the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split, with a random seed of 0. The
optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and the number of training
epochs is 500.
