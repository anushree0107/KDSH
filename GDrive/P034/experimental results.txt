 We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
was computed and clipped to [âˆ’20,20]. For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames
(8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in
3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adam
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50
epochs.

6.2 Segmented Video Activity Recognition
We initially conducted binary pitch/non-pitch classification for each video segment. This task is
We define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize the
parameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss
function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from
the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split, with a random seed of 0. The
optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and the number of training
epochs is 500.
