PCEDT functors appear less than 20 times), making it doubtful whether any ML model could learn
them under any circumstances.
Given this imbalanced distribution, it is evident that accuracy alone is insufficient to determine the
best-performing model. Therefore, in the subsequent section, we report and analyze the F1 scores of
the predicted NomBank and PCEDT relations across all STL, TL, and MTL models.
7.2 Per-Relation F1 Scores
Tables 4 and 5 present the per-relation F1 scores for NomBank and PCEDT, respectively. We only
include results for relations that are actually predicted by at least one of the models.

dataset.
Secondly, with the exception of the MTLF model, all TL and MTL models consistently improve
the F1 score for all PCEDT relations except PAT. Notably, the F1 scores for the relations TWHEN
and ACT show a substantial increase compared to other PCEDT relations when only the embedding
layerâ€™s weights are shared (MTLE) or transferred (TLE). This outcome can be partially understood
by examining the correspondence matrices between NomBank arguments and PCEDT functors,
presented in Tables 7 and 6.
