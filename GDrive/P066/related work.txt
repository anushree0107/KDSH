trained by Fares et al. (2017). If a word is not found during lookup in the embedding model, we
check if the word is uppercased and attempt to find the lowercase version. For hyphenated words
not found in the embedding vocabulary, we split the word at the hyphen and average the vectors of
its parts, if they are present in the vocabulary. If the word remains unrepresented after these steps, a
designated vector for unknown words is employed.
5.1.1 Architecture and Hyperparameters
Our selection of hyperparameters is informed by multiple rounds of experimentation with the single-
task learning model, as well as the choices made by prior work. The weights of the embedding layer
 Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned
studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in
that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using
the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment
with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single
MTL model on two sets of relations.
3 Task Definition and Dataset
The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs
of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of
 Our goal is to learn a function f(X) that predicts Y based on the input features X.
Considering two ML tasks, Ta and Tb, we would train two distinct models to learn separate functions
fa and fb for predicting Ya and Yb in a single-task learning scenario. However, if Ta and Tb are
related, either explicitly or implicitly, TL and MTL can enhance the generalization of either or both
tasks. Two tasks are deemed related when their domains are similar but their label sets differ, or when
their domains are dissimilar but their label sets are identical. Consequently, noun-noun compound
interpretation using the dataset is well-suited for TL and MTL, as the training examples are identical,
