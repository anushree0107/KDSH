We confirm the efficacy and logic of PAAC in reducing popularity bias through thorough experiments on three
real-world datasets.
1 Introduction
Contemporary recommender systems are essential in reducing information overload. Personalized recommendations frequently
employ collaborative filtering (CF) to assist users in discovering items that may interest them. CF-based techniques primarily
learn user preferences and item attributes by matching the representations of users with the items they engage with. Despite their
achievements, CF-based methods frequently encounter the issue of popularity bias, which leads to considerable disparities in
accuracy between items that are popular and those that are not. Popularity bias occurs because there are limited supervisory signals
We implement the state-of-the-art LightGCN to instantiate PAAC, aiming to investigate how it alleviates popularity bias. We
compare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models, decorrelation-based models, and contrastive
learning-based models.
We utilize three widely used metrics, namely Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K, to evaluate the performance of Top-K recommen-
dation. Recall@K and HR@K assess the number of target items retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. In
contrast, NDCG@K evaluates the positions of target items in the ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. We use
 This approach has been demonstrated as a state-of-the-art
method for alleviating popularity bias. It employs data augmentation techniques such as graph augmentation or feature
augmentation to generate different views, maximizing positive pair consistency and minimizing negative pair consistency
to promote more uniform representations. Specifically, Adap- Ï„adjusts user/item embeddings to specific values, while
SimGCL integrates InfoNCE loss to enhance representation uniformity and alleviate popularity bias.
4.2 Representation Learning for CF
Representation learning is crucial in recommendation systems, especially in modern collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. It
creates personalized embeddings that capture user preferences and item characteristics. The quality of these representations critically
