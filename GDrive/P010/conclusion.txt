We confirm the efficacy and logic of PAAC in reducing popularity bias through thorough experiments on three
real-world datasets.
1 Introduction
Contemporary recommender systems are essential in reducing information overload. Personalized recommendations frequently
employ collaborative filtering (CF) to assist users in discovering items that may interest them. CF-based techniques primarily
learn user preferences and item attributes by matching the representations of users with the items they engage with. Despite their
achievements, CF-based methods frequently encounter the issue of popularity bias, which leads to considerable disparities in
accuracy between items that are popular and those that are not. Popularity bias occurs because there are limited supervisory signals
We implement the state-of-the-art LightGCN to instantiate PAAC, aiming to investigate how it alleviates popularity bias. We
compare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models, decorrelation-based models, and contrastive
learning-based models.
We utilize three widely used metrics, namely Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K, to evaluate the performance of Top-K recommen-
dation. Recall@K and HR@K assess the number of target items retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. In
contrast, NDCG@K evaluates the positions of target items in the ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. We use

Contrastive Learning
Abstract
Collaborative Filtering (CF) often encounters substantial difficulties with popularity bias because of the skewed
distribution of items in real-world datasets. This tendency creates a notable difference in accuracy between items
that are popular and those that are not. This discrepancy impedes the accurate comprehension of user preferences
and intensifies the Matthew effect within recommendation systems. To counter popularity bias, current methods
concentrate on highlighting less popular items or on differentiating the correlation between item representations
and their popularity. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches continue to grapple with two significant
