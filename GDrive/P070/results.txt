Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

4.2.2 VolETA Results
The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

After finding keyframes, PixSfM estimated the poses and point cloud. After generating scaled meshes,
the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Meshes
were registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics.
Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with and
without estimated transformation metrics from ICP.
