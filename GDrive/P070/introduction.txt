The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
In computational linguistics, noun-noun compound interpretation is typically treated as an automatic
classification task. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms and models, such as Maximum
Entropy, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, have been employed to decipher the
semantics of nominal compounds. These models utilize information from lexical semantics, like
WordNet-based features, and distributional semantics, such as word embeddings. However, noun-
noun compound interpretation remains a challenging NLP problem due to the high productivity
of noun-noun compounding as a linguistic structure and the difficulty in deriving the semantics of
noun-noun compounds from their constituents. Our research contributes to advancing NLP research
 Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned
studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in
that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using
the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment
with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single
MTL model on two sets of relations.
3 Task Definition and Dataset
The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs
of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of
