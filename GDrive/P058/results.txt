To better comprehend lexical memorization’s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each
8
relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
PCEDT have distinctly high ratios compared to other relations in Figure 2. These relations also
have the second-highest F1 score in their datasets—except for STL on PCEDT (see Tables 4 and
5). Lexical memorization is therefore a likely cause of these high F1 scores. We also observed that
lower ratios of relation-specific constituents correlate with lower F1 scores, such as APP and REG in
PCEDT. Based on these insights, we can’t dismiss the possibility that our models show some degree
of lexical memorization, despite manual analysis also presenting cases where models demonstrate
generalization and correct predictions in situations where lexical memorization is impossible.

observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
