 - A modified transformer
encoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforce
dependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoder
to learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacing
the context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposed
network (i.e.has been discovered that pooling intervals from varying locations and durations is advantageous for
activity recognition. It was demonstrated that identifying and classifying key sub-event intervals can
lead to better performance.
Recently, segment-based 3D CNNs have been employed to capture spatio-temporal data concurrently
for activity detection. These methods depend on the 3D CNN to capture temporal dynamics, which
typically span only 16 frames. Although longer-term temporal structures have been explored, this was
usually accomplished with temporal pooling of localized features or (spatio-)temporal convolutions
with extended fixed intervals. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been applied to represent
transitions in activity between frames.

to utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the local
context is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of time
might have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers. We utilize a combination of causal convolution layers and
self-attention layers, which we name Dual Convolutional Self-Attention (DCSA). The DCSA takes in a primary input ˆx1∈RN×d
and a secondary input ˆx2∈RN×dand yields:
