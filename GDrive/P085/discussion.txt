whether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications.

Table 1 shows the performance of a standard, unconstrained network and our safe predictor. For both
networks, we present the percentage accuracy (ACC) and violations (percentage of inputs for which
the network outputs an unsafe advisory). We train and test using PyTorch with two separate datasets,
based on the previous advisory being Clear of Conflict (COC) and Climb at 1500 ft/min (CL1500).
As shown in the table, our safe predictor adheres to the required safeability property. Furthermore,
