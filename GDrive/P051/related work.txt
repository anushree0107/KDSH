in the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especially
since the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks.
4 Transfer vs. Multi-Task Learning
In this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) to
articulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be described
in terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the input
feature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task is
defined by X, P(X).The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are

Interpreting Noun-Noun Compounds
Abstract
This study examines the effectiveness of transfer learning and multi-task learning
in the context of a complex semantic classification problem: understanding the
meaning of noun-noun compounds. Through a series of detailed experiments and
an in-depth analysis of errors, we demonstrate that employing transfer learning by
initializing parameters and multi-task learning through parameter sharing enables a
neural classification model to better generalize across a dataset characterized by a
highly uneven distribution of semantic relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate
how utilizing dual annotations, which involve two distinct sets of relations applied
to the same compounds, can enhance the overall precision of a neural classifier and
