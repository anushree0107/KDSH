1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
 The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an
average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.
The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will
perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art
model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,
