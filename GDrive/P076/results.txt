Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-
icking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary

recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based
on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single
top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of
proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use
of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,
would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart home’s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
 Localization could also provide valuable information in the measurement of other behaviors such as non-motor symptoms like
urinary function (e.g., how many times someone visits the toilet room overnight).
IoT-based platforms with sensors capturing various modalities of data, combined with machine learning, can be used for unobtrusive
and continuous indoor localization in home environments. Many of these techniques utilize radio-frequency signals, specifically the
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), emitted by wearables and measured at access points (AP) throughout a home. These
signals estimate the user’s position based on perceived signal strength, creating radio-map features for each room. To improve
