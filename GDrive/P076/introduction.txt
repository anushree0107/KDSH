Safe Predictors for Input-Output Specification
Enforcement
Abstract
This paper presents an approach for designing neural networks, along with other
machine learning models, which adhere to a collection of input-output specifica-
tions. Our method involves the construction of a constrained predictor for each set
of compatible constraints, and combining these predictors in a safe manner using a
convex combination of their predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of this
method with synthetic datasets and on an aircraft collision avoidance problem.
1 Introduction
The increasing adoption of machine learning models, such as neural networks, in safety-critical
applications, such as autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance, highlights an urgent
need for the development of guarantees on safety and robustness.the specifications until after training. Our work seeks to design networks with enforced input-output
constraints even before training has been completed. This will allow for online learning scenarios
where a system has to guarantee safety throughout its operation.
This paper presents an approach for designing a safe predictor (a neural network or any other
machine learning model) that will always meet a set of constraints on the input-output relationship.
This assumes that the constrained output regions can be formulated to be convex. Our correct-
by-construction safe predictor is guaranteed to satisfy the constraints, even before training, and at
every training step. We describe our approach in Section 2, and show its use in an aircraft collision
avoidance problem in Section 3.function is smooth.
3 Application to Aircraft Collision Avoidance
Aircraft collision avoidance requires robust safety guarantees. The Next-Generation Collision
Avoidance System (ACAS X), which issues advisories to prevent near mid-air collisions, has both
manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned (ACAS Xu) variants. The system was originally designed to
choose optimal advisories while minimizing disruptive alerts by solving a partially observable Markov
decision process. The solution took the form of a large look-up table, mapping each possible input
combination to scores for all possible advisories. The advisory with the highest score would then be
issued.
