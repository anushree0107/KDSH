several activities, this is considered a multi-label classification task. Table 1 presents the complete
list of activities and their respective counts within the dataset. Additionally, clips featuring a pitch
were annotated with the type of pitch (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider) and its speed. Furthermore, a
collection of 2,983 hard negative examples, where no action is present, was gathered. These instances
include views of the crowd, the field, or players standing idly before or after a pitch. Examples of
activities and hard negatives are depicted in Figure 2.
Our continuous video dataset includes 2,128 clips, each lasting between 1 and 2 minutes. Every

Abstract
This research introduces MLB-YouTube, a new and complex dataset created for
nuanced activity recognition in baseball videos. This dataset is structured to
support two types of analysis: one for classifying activities in segmented videos
and another for detecting activities in unsegmented, continuous video streams. This
study evaluates several methods for recognizing activities, focusing on how they
capture the temporal organization of activities in videos. This evaluation starts
with categorizing segmented videos and progresses to applying these methods
to continuous video feeds. Additionally, this paper assesses the effectiveness of
different models in the challenging task of forecasting pitch velocity and type
using baseball broadcast videos. The findings indicate that incorporating temporal
frame in these videos is annotated with the baseball activities that occur. On average, each continuous
clip contains 7.2 activities, amounting to over 15,000 activity instances in total.

4 Segmented Video Recognition Approach
We investigate different techniques for aggregating temporal features in segmented video activity
recognition. In segmented videos, the classification task is simpler because each frame corresponds to
