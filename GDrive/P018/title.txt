 It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,
termed "weak Minty," without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.
Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as
the update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the
length of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is
of EG+ that adaptively chooses the ratio of extrapolation and update steps. In addition, a backtracking linesearch is performed with
an initial guess made by second-order information, whose extra cost we ignore in the experiments.
5.1 Von Neumann’s ratio game
We consider von Neumann’s ratio game, which is given by:
min
x∈∆mmax
y∈∆nV(x, y) =⟨x, Ry⟩
⟨x, Sy⟩, (5)
When used to produce proximity functions as given in Equation 1, these values help ensure safety.
Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function, and proximity function for the
CL1500 advisory.
C.3 Structure of Predictors
The compressed versions of the policy tables from prior work are neural networks with six hidden
layers, 45 dimensions in each layer, and ReLU activation functions. We use the same architecture
for our standard, unconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture.
However, the first four hidden layers are shared between all of the predictors. This learns a single,
shared input space representation, and also allows each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each
