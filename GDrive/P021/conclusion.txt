 Conversely, SGMs
employ score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating new
samples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varying
noise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the score
function for all noise levels has been proposed.
Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the score
function, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) has been derived.We apply two different layers to produce two different outputs during training. The room-level predictions are produced via a single
conditional random field (CRF) layer in combination with a linear layer applied to the output of Eq. 7 to produce the final predictions
as:
ˆyt=CRF (φ(ht)) (7)
q′(ht) =Wpht+bp (8)
where Wp∈Rd×mandbp∈Rmare the weight and bias to learn, mis the number of room locations, and h= [h1, ..., h T]∈RT×d

The random functional || · || malso defines a seminorm on L2(Rd, μx), referred to as the empirical
norm. Under mild assumptions, || · || mfails to be a norm.
In order to obtain a well generalizing model, the goal is to identify a function fwith a low expected
risk. However, with limited data, we are restricted to optimizing the empirical risk. Our strategy for
