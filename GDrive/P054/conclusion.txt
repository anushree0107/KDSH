exhibited superior performance in Phase-II, highlighting a competitive and high-caliber field of
entries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully advanced the field of 3D food
reconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction
in nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The novel methods developed by the
participating teams establish a strong foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading
to more precise and user-friendly approaches for dietary assessment and monitoring.

MetaFood Challenge Techniques and Outcomes
Abstract
The growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri-
tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods
for food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited
collaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly
hindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by
introducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically
accurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-
ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels
