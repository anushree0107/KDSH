technologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to
diet.
By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual
inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the
disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique
solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also
meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer
vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.
These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food
Advancements in 3D Food Modeling: A Review of the
MetaFood Challenge Techniques and Outcomes
Abstract
The growing focus on leveraging computer vision for dietary oversight and nutri-
tion tracking has spurred the creation of sophisticated 3D reconstruction methods
for food. The lack of comprehensive, high-fidelity data, coupled with limited
collaborative efforts between academic and industrial sectors, has significantly
hindered advancements in this domain. This study addresses these obstacles by
introducing the MetaFood Challenge, aimed at generating precise, volumetrically
accurate 3D food models from 2D images, utilizing a checkerboard for size cal-
ibration. The challenge was structured around 20 food items across three levels
exhibited superior performance in Phase-II, highlighting a competitive and high-caliber field of
entries for 3D mesh reconstruction. The challenge has successfully advanced the field of 3D food
reconstruction, demonstrating the potential for accurate volume estimation and shape reconstruction
in nutritional analysis and food presentation applications. The novel methods developed by the
participating teams establish a strong foundation for future research in this area, potentially leading
to more precise and user-friendly approaches for dietary assessment and monitoring.
