portion estimation across diverse applications, from individual health tracking to extensive nutritional
investigations.
Conventional methods for assessing diet, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires
(FFQs), are frequently reliant on manual data entry, which is prone to inaccuracies and can be
burdensome. The lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images further complicates the use of regression-
based methods for estimating food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By enhancing
3D reconstruction for food, the aim is to provide more accurate and intuitive nutritional assessment
tools. This technology could revolutionize the sharing of culinary experiences and significantly
impact nutrition science and public health.
technologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to
diet.
By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual
inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the
disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique
solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also
meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer
vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.
These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food
of complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A
total of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies
developed during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in
3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in
dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop
