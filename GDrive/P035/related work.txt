provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an ox’s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.
In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from
The Importance of Written Explanations in
Aggregating Crowdsourced Predictions
Abstract
This study demonstrates that incorporating the written explanations provided by
individuals when making predictions enhances the accuracy of aggregated crowd-
sourced forecasts. The research shows that while majority and weighted vote
methods are effective, the inclusion of written justifications improves forecast
accuracy throughout most of a question’s duration, with the exception of its final
phase. Furthermore, the study analyzes the attributes that differentiate reliable and
unreliable justifications.
1 Introduction
The concept of the "wisdom of the crowd" posits that combining information from numerous non-
expert individuals can produce answers that are as accurate as, or even more accurate than, those
 Furthermore, we introduce a modified
version of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problem’s
specific parameters.
1 Introduction
The recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,
have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,
adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed
that generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization
component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in
certain cases.
