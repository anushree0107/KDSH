applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

**Limitations and future research:** One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size (which was planned as this is
an exploratory pilot study). We believe our sample size is ample to show proof of concept. This is also the first such work with
unobtrusive ground truth validation from embedded cameras. Future work should validate our approach further on a large cohort
of people with PD and consider stratifying for sub-groups within PD (e.g., akinetic-rigid or tremor-dominant phenotypes), which
technologies are vital for fostering healthier eating behaviors and addressing health issues linked to
diet.
By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual
inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the
disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique
solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also
meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer
vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.
These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food
