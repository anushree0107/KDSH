L/2,L/4, and L/8, resulting in 14 segments per window. Max-pooling is applied to each segment,
and the pooled features are concatenated, yielding a 14×D-dimensional representation for each
window, which is then used as input to the classifier.
For temporal convolutional models in continuous videos, we modify the segmented video approach by
learning a temporal convolutional kernel of length Land convolving it with the input video features.
This operation transforms input of size T×Dinto output of size T×D, followed by a per-frame
classifier. This enables the model to aggregate local temporal information.

7 Conclusion
This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel and challenging dataset designed for detailed activity
recognition in videos. We conduct a comparative analysis of various recognition techniques that
employ temporal feature pooling for both segmented and continuous videos. Our findings reveal that
learning sub-events to pinpoint temporal regions of interest significantly enhances performance in
segmented video classification. In the context of activity detection in continuous videos, we establish
This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi-
ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition or
detection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activities
are often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scene
structure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. This
study compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities in
segmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams.
