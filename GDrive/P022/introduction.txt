particularly when collected from wrist-worn devices, which are a common and well-accepted placement location. Naively combining
accelerometer data with RSSI may degrade indoor localization performance due to varying tremor levels in the acceleration signal.
This work makes two primary contributions to address these challenges.
(1) We detail the use of RSSI, augmented by accelerometer data, to achieve room-level localization. Our proposed network
intelligently selects accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization. To rigorously assess our
method, we utilize a free-living dataset (where individuals live without external intervention) developed by our group, encompassing
diverse and unstructured movements as expected in real-world scenarios.dynamics into models is beneficial for detailed activity recognition.
1 Introduction
Action recognition, a significant problem in computer vision, finds extensive use in sports. Profes-
sional sporting events are extensively recorded for entertainment, and these recordings are invaluable
for subsequent analysis by coaches, scouts, and media analysts. While numerous game statistics
are currently gathered manually, the potential exists for these to be replaced by computer vision
systems. Systems like PITCHf/x and Statcast have been employed by Major League Baseball (MLB)
to automatically record pitch speed and movement, utilizing a network of high-speed cameras and
radar to collect detailed data on each player. Access to much of this data is restricted from the public
domain.
provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an oxâ€™s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.
In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from
