provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an oxâ€™s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.
In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from

6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle
6.1 Methodology
To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as
depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-
motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,
a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh
quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to
facilitate model generation.
6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction
particularly when collected from wrist-worn devices, which are a common and well-accepted placement location. Naively combining
accelerometer data with RSSI may degrade indoor localization performance due to varying tremor levels in the acceleration signal.
This work makes two primary contributions to address these challenges.
(1) We detail the use of RSSI, augmented by accelerometer data, to achieve room-level localization. Our proposed network
intelligently selects accelerometer features that can enhance RSSI performance in indoor localization. To rigorously assess our
method, we utilize a free-living dataset (where individuals live without external intervention) developed by our group, encompassing
diverse and unstructured movements as expected in real-world scenarios.
