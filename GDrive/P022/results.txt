 They then projected the 3D
object back onto the original 2D image to obtain a more precise scale for the object.
6.2 Experimental Results
Through a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that
minimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization
aimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion
of this process, the average Chamfer dis- tance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects
amounted to 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for

6.1 Methodology
To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as
depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-
motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,
a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh
quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to
facilitate model generation.

applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.
