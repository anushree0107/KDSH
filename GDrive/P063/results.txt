 This method refined the uniformity of representations and successfully reduced separation. We
validated our method, PAAC, on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and underlying rationale.
In the future, we will explore deeper alignment and contrast adjustments tailored to specific tasks to further mitigate popularity
bias. We aim to investigate the synergies between alignment and contrast and extend our approach to address other biases in
recommendation systems.

It could be argued that all the localization models compared in Table 1 might not be statistically different due to the fairly high
standard deviation across all types of cross-validations, which is caused by the relatively small number of participants. In order to
compare multiple models over cross-validation sets and show the statistical significance of our proposed model, we perform the
Friedman test to first reject the null hypothesis. We then performed a pairwise statistical comparison: the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
with Holmâ€™s alpha correction.

reveals three primary themes: elections (including terms like "voting," "winners," and "candidate"),
government actions (including terms like "negotiations," "announcements," "meetings," and "passing
(a law)"), and wars and violent crimes (including terms like "groups," "killing," "civilian (casualties),"
and "arms"). Although not explicitly represented in the LDA topics, the questions address both
domestic and international events within these broad themes.
