Many relations in PCEDT and NomBank conceptually describe similar semantic ideas, as they are
used to annotate the semantics of the same text.Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

4.2.2 VolETA Results
The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results
 For instance, the temporal and locative relations in
NomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC, respectively) and their PCEDT counterparts (TWHEN
and LOC) exhibit relatively consistent behavior across frameworks, as they annotate many of the
same compounds. However, some relations that are theoretically similar do not align well in practice.
For example, the functor AIM in PCEDT and the modifier argument ARGM-PNC in NomBank
express a somewhat related semantic concept (purpose), but there is minimal overlap between the
sets of compounds they annotate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the semantic similarity
