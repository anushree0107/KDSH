represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide
insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house
where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows
the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living
room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across
all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e.77 (13.19) 48.61 (12.03) 76.39 (12.23)
Demographic Features 36.69 (18.15) 50.53 (15.60)
In naturalistic settings, in-home mobility can be measured through the use of indoor localization models. We have shown, using
room transition duration results, that our PD cohort takes longer on average to perform a room transition when they withhold
medications. With accurate in-home gait speed features, a classifier model can then differentiate accurately if a person with PD is in
an ON or OFF medication state. Such changes show the promise of these localization outputs to detect the dopamine-related gait
 the time spent in the hallway) to 60 seconds to exclude
transitions likely to be prolonged and thus may not be representative of the person’s mobility.
These in-home gait speed features are produced by an indoor-localization model by feeding RSSI signals and accelerometer data
from 12 PD participants from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, which are aggregated into 4-hour windows. From this, each PD participant
will have 20 data samples (four data samples for each of the five days), each of which contains six features (three for the mean of
room-to-room transition duration and three for the number of room-to-room transitions). There is only one 4-hour window during
