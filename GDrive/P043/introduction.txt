After finding keyframes, PixSfM estimated the poses and point cloud. After generating scaled meshes,
the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Meshes
were registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics.
Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with and
without estimated transformation metrics from ICP.scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the fine-tuned scaling factor Sfis applied to the
cleaned food mesh RCf, producing the final scaled food mesh RFf. This step culminates in an
accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object, enabling precise volume estimation.
4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor
Generally, 3D reconstruction methods produce unitless meshes by default. To address this, the team
manually determines the scaling factor by measuring the distance for each block of the reference
object mesh. The average of all block lengths lavgis calculated, while the actual real-world length is
constant at lreal= 0.012meters.The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
