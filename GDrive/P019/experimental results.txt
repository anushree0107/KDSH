sample, there will be a corresponding demographic feature data sample that is used to train a different binary classifier to predict
whether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications.
**Ethical approval:** Full approval from the NHS Wales Research Ethics Committee was granted on December 17, 2019, and
Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales approval was confirmed on January 14, 2020; the research was

conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975; written informed consent was gained from all study participants. In
order to protect participant privacy, supporting data is not shared openly. It will be made available to bona fide researchers subject to
a data access agreement.
4 Methodologies and Framework
 Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,
concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer
2
data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previous
work that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binary
classifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.
3 Cohort and Dataset
The metric we use for ON/OFF medication state evaluation is the weighted F1-Score and AUROC, which are averaged and standard
deviated across the test folds.
5.1 Experimental Results
**Room-level Accuracy:** The first part of Table 1 compares the performance of the MDCSA network and other approaches for
room-level classification. For room-level classification, the MDCSA network outperforms other networks and RF with a minimum
improvement of 1.3% for the F1-score over the second-best network in each cross-validation type, with the exception of the ALL-HC
validation.
