The metric we use for ON/OFF medication state evaluation is the weighted F1-Score and AUROC, which are averaged and standard
deviated across the test folds.
5.1 Experimental Results
**Room-level Accuracy:** The first part of Table 1 compares the performance of the MDCSA network and other approaches for
room-level classification. For room-level classification, the MDCSA network outperforms other networks and RF with a minimum
improvement of 1.3% for the F1-score over the second-best network in each cross-validation type, with the exception of the ALL-HC
validation. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,
concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer

data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previous
work that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binary
classifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.
3 Cohort and Dataset
test was used on the annotated data from PD participants undertaking each of the three individual transitions between rooms whilst
ON (taking) and OFF (withholding) medications to assess whether the mean transition duration ON medications was statistically
significantly shorter than the mean transition duration for the same transition OFF medications for all transitions studied (see Table
4). From this result, we argue that the mean transition duration obtained by each model from Table 1 that is close to the ground truth
can capture what the ground truth captures. As mentioned in Section 3, this transition duration for each model is generated by the
model continuously performing room-level localization, focusing on the time a person is predicted to spend in a hallway between
rooms.
