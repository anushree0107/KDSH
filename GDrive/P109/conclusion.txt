The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of the
domain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that
TL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relations
within a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularly
well-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when applied
to the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in a
