convolution appear to overfit. Convolutional sub-events, especially when combined with super-event
representation, significantly enhance performance, particularly for frame-based features.

Despite their relative simplicity, the baseline methods achieve commendable results, demonstrating
that aggregating forecaster predictions without considering the question or justifications is a viable
strategy. However, the full neural network achieves significantly improved results.
**Using Daily or Active Forecasts** Incorporating active forecasts, rather than solely relying on
forecasts submitted on the day the question is called, proves advantageous for both baselines and all
 The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an
average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.
The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will
perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art
model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,
