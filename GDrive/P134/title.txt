dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
