 It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,
termed "weak Minty," without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.
Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as
the update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the
length of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is
 It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty
solutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and
an improved convergence rate of O(1/k2)(in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of
the reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty
solutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty
solution). It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While
the assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone
problems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point
by a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.
Negative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term "cohypomonotonicity," the concept of negative comono-
tonicity has recently been explored.
