our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
In computational linguistics, noun-noun compound interpretation is typically treated as an automatic
classification task. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms and models, such as Maximum
Entropy, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, have been employed to decipher the
semantics of nominal compounds. These models utilize information from lexical semantics, like
WordNet-based features, and distributional semantics, such as word embeddings. However, noun-
noun compound interpretation remains a challenging NLP problem due to the high productivity
of noun-noun compounding as a linguistic structure and the difficulty in deriving the semantics of
noun-noun compounds from their constituents. Our research contributes to advancing NLP research
layers: 1) an input layer, 2) an embedding layer, 3) a hidden layer, and 4) an output layer. The input

layer consists of two integers that indicate the indices of a compound’s constituents in the embedding
layer, where the word embedding vectors are stored. These selected vectors are then passed to a fully
connected hidden layer, the size of which matches the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors.
Finally, a softmax function is applied to the output layer to select the most probable relation.
The compound’s constituents are represented using a 300-dimensional word embedding model trained
on an English Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword Fifth Edition. The embedding model was
