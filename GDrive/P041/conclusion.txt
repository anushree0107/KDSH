 A strong justification for a forecast can be considered a well-reasoned supporting argument.
Previous work in this area includes identifying argument components such as claims, premises,
backing, rebuttals, and refutations, as well as mining arguments that support or oppose a particular
claim. Despite these efforts, it was found that crowdsourced justifications rarely adhere to these
established argumentation frameworks, even though such justifications are valuable for aggregating
forecasts.
Finally, several studies have focused on forecasting using datasets similar or identical to the one used
in this research. From a psychological perspective, researchers have explored strategies for enhancing
forecasting accuracy, such as utilizing top-performing forecasters (often called "superforecasters"),
explanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be considered
weaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources.
To clarify the terminology used: a "question" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,
"Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?"). Questions have a defined start and
end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the "life" of the question. "Forecasters"
are individuals who provide a "forecast," which consists of a "prediction" and a "justification." The
prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification
is the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction.their predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of

the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.
Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"
"help"), "cognition" (e.g., "think," "believe," "know"), and "motion" (e.g.
