 These tables illustrate how PCEDT functors map to NomBank arguments
in the training split (Table 6) and vice versa (Table 7). Table 6 reveals that 80% of the compounds
annotated as TWHEN in PCEDT were annotated as ARGM-TMP in NomBank. Additionally, 47% of
ACT (Actor) relations map to ARG0 (Proto-Agent) in NomBank. While this mapping is not as distinct
as one might hope, it is still relatively high when compared to how other PCEDT relations map to
ARG0. The correspondence matrices also demonstrate that the presumed theoretical similarities
between NomBank and PCEDT relations do not always hold in practice. This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.
To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR
i}n
i=1, and
food object masks {MF
i}n
i=1. This step, denoted as {IR
i}n
i=1, integrates various data sources into a
unified format for further processing.
The team converts the RGBA images {IR
i}n
i=1and camera poses {Cj}k
j=1into meaningful metadata
and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.
The modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes
would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart homeâ€™s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
