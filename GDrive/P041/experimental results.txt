Table 5 shows the average precision for each activity class. Learning temporal structure is particularly
beneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information

compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detecting
that incorporating convolutional sub-events with a super-event representation, creating a three-level
activity hierarchy, yields the most favorable outcomes.
