would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart homeâ€™s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to

Table 5 shows the average precision for each activity class. Learning temporal structure is particularly
beneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information

compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detecting
that incorporating convolutional sub-events with a super-event representation, creating a three-level
activity hierarchy, yields the most favorable outcomes.
