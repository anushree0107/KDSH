 We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
an activity, eliminating the need for the model to identify the start and end of activities. Our methods
are based on a CNN that generates a per-frame or per-segment representation, derived from standard
two-stream CNNs using deep CNNs like I3D or InceptionV3.
Given video features vof dimensions T×D, where Trepresents the video’s temporal length and D
is the feature’s dimensionality, the usual approach for feature pooling involves max- or mean-pooling
across the temporal dimension, followed by a fully-connected layer for video clip classification, as
depicted in Fig. 5(a). This approach, however, yields a single representation for the entire video,
losing temporal information.sequential processing of video features, whereas other methods can be fully parallelized.
