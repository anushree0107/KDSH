1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.to utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the local
context is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of time
might have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers. We utilize a combination of causal convolution layers and
self-attention layers, which we name Dual Convolutional Self-Attention (DCSA). The DCSA takes in a primary input ˆx1∈RN×d
and a secondary input ˆx2∈RN×dand yields:
are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the model’s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
