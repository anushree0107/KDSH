To clarify the terminology used: a "question" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,
"Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?"). Questions have a defined start and
end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the "life" of the question. "Forecasters"

prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification
