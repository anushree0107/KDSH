isolated piece removal and scaling factor adjustments, enhance accuracy. This approach provides a
thorough solution for accurate food volume assessment, with potential uses in nutrition analysis.
4.1.2 The Team’s Proposal: VolETA
The team starts by acquiring input data, specifically RGBD images and corresponding food object
masks. The RGBD images, denoted as ID={IDi}n
i=1, where nis the total number of frames,
provide depth information alongside RGB images. The food object masks, {Mf
i}n
i=1, help identify
regions of interest within these images.
Next, the team selects keyframes. From the set {IDi}n
represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide
insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house
where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows
the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living
room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across
all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e.02426 230×265 (294 ×431×2.353)
