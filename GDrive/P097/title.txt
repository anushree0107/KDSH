 It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty
solutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and
an improved convergence rate of O(1/k2)(in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of
the reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty
solutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty
solution). On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,
has received much less attention and is given by:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥ − γ∥F(u)−F(v)∥2.
Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.
Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient
to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of
 Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient
norm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate
this class from problems with weak Minty solutions.

Interaction dominance. The concept of α-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,
and it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both
components. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively
comonotone.
Optimism.
