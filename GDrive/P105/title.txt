After finding keyframes, PixSfM estimated the poses and point cloud. After generating scaled meshes,
the team calculated volumes and Chamfer distance with and without transformation metrics. Meshes
were registered with ground truth meshes using ICP to obtain transformation metrics.
Table 3 presents quantitative comparisons of the team’s volumes and Chamfer distance with and
without estimated transformation metrics from ICP.their predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of

the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.
Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"
"help"), "cognition" (e.g., "think," "believe," "know"), and "motion" (e.g.
