where Znis a normalization constant, t∈ {1,2, . . . , T }, and n∈ {1,2, . . . , N }.
The filters are combined with learned per-class soft-attention weights A, and the super-event repre-
sentation is computed as:
Sc=X

where vis the T×Dvideo representation. These filters enable the model to focus on relevant
intervals for temporal context. The super-event representation is concatenated to each timestep and
used for classification.represents how active PD subjects are within a certain period of time, while ’Room-to-room Transition Duration’ may provide
insight into how severe their disease is by the speed with which they navigate their home environment. With the layout of the house
where participants stayed, the hallway is used as a hub connecting all other rooms labeled, and ’Room-to-room Transition’ shows
the transition duration (in seconds) between two rooms connected by the hallway. The transition between (1) kitchen and living
room, (2) kitchen and dining room, and (3) dining room and living room are chosen as the features due to their commonality across
all participants. For these features, we limit the transition time duration (i.e.that incorporating convolutional sub-events with a super-event representation, creating a three-level
activity hierarchy, yields the most favorable outcomes.
