 The central problem addressed in
this work is termed "calling a question," which refers to the process of determining a final prediction
by aggregating individual forecasts. Two strategies are employed for calling questions each day
throughout their life: considering forecasts submitted on the given day ("daily") and considering the
last forecast submitted by each forecaster ("active").
Inspired by prior research on recognizing and fostering skilled forecasters, and analyzing written
justifications to assess the quality of individual or collective forecasts, this paper investigates the
automated calling of questions throughout their duration based on the forecasts available each day.
The primary contributions are empirical findings that address the following research questions:
Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions
and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,
empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current studyâ€™s focus,
researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within
online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including
within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.
The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,
without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.
Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-
tation.large groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. If
not, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individual
judgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom.
This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and social
domains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, and
a written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identical
predictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliability
of the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source without
