approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,
and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D
reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting
to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,
and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the
organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and

impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.
3 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline
3.1 Dataset Description
Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
found with the data for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget), so these items were excluded
from the final overall evaluation.

4.1 Methodology
The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate
precise food volumes.
4.1.1 Overview
The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume
from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual
hashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural
surface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including
