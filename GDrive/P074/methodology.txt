Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
L/2,L/4, and L/8, resulting in 14 segments per window. Max-pooling is applied to each segment,
and the pooled features are concatenated, yielding a 14×D-dimensional representation for each
window, which is then used as input to the classifier.
For temporal convolutional models in continuous videos, we modify the segmented video approach by
learning a temporal convolutional kernel of length Land convolving it with the input video features.
This operation transforms input of size T×Dinto output of size T×D, followed by a per-frame
classifier. This enables the model to aggregate local temporal information.
would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart home’s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
