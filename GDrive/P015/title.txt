Safe Predictors for Input-Output Specification
Enforcement
Abstract
This paper presents an approach for designing neural networks, along with other
machine learning models, which adhere to a collection of input-output specifica-
tions. Our method involves the construction of a constrained predictor for each set
of compatible constraints, and combining these predictors in a safe manner using a
convex combination of their predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of this
method with synthetic datasets and on an aircraft collision avoidance problem.
1 Introduction
The increasing adoption of machine learning models, such as neural networks, in safety-critical
applications, such as autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance, highlights an urgent
need for the development of guarantees on safety and robustness.credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do
not require tracking individual forecasters.

has been discovered that pooling intervals from varying locations and durations is advantageous for
activity recognition. It was demonstrated that identifying and classifying key sub-event intervals can
lead to better performance.
Recently, segment-based 3D CNNs have been employed to capture spatio-temporal data concurrently
for activity detection. These methods depend on the 3D CNN to capture temporal dynamics, which
typically span only 16 frames. Although longer-term temporal structures have been explored, this was
usually accomplished with temporal pooling of localized features or (spatio-)temporal convolutions
with extended fixed intervals. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been applied to represent
transitions in activity between frames.
