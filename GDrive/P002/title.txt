Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle
6.1 Methodology
To achieve high-fidelity food mesh reconstruction, the team developed two procedural pipelines as
depicted in Figure 14. For simple and medium complexity cases, they employed a structure-from-
motion strategy to ascertain the pose of each image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently,
a sequence of post-processing steps was implemented to recalibrate the scale and improve mesh
quality. For cases involving only a single image, the team utilized image generation techniques to
facilitate model generation.

factors, PPU, 2D reference object dimensions, 3D food object dimensions, and potential volume.
For one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team uses One-2-3-45 to reconstruct a 3D model from a single
RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation to both food RGB and mask images.
Isolated pieces are removed from the generated mesh, and the scaling factor S, which is closer to the
potential volume of the clean mesh, is reused.
