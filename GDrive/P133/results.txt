To better comprehend lexical memorization’s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each
8
relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
 Nevertheless, even such
imperfect correspondences can provide a training signal that assists the TL and MTL models in
learning relations like TWHEN and ACT.
Since the TLE model outperforms STL in predicting REG by ten absolute points, we examined
all REG compounds correctly classified by TLE but misclassified by STL. We found that STL
misclassified them as RSTR, indicating that TL from NomBank helps TLE recover from STL’s
overgeneralization in RSTR prediction.
The two NomBank relations that receive the highest boost in F1 score (about five absolute points)
are ARG0 and ARGM-MNR, but the improvement in the latter corresponds to only one additional
