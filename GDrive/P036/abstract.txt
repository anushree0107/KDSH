The average depth is then calculated using the segmented reference object depth ( dr). Similarly,
employing binary image segmentation with an overhead food object mask and depth image, the
average depth for the segmented food depth image ( df) is computed. The estimated food height fhis
the absolute difference between dranddf. To assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the food
bounding box volume (fw×fl×fh)×PPU is computed. The team evaluates if the scaling factor
Sgenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine. Table 2 lists the scaling
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
