connected layer is used for classification, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c).
While temporal pyramid pooling retains some structure, the intervals are fixed and predetermined.
Previous studies have shown that learning the sub-interval to pool is beneficial for activity recognition.
These learned intervals are defined by three parameters: a center g, a width σ, and a stride δ,
parameterizing NGaussians. Given the video length T, the positions of the strided Gaussians are
first calculated as:
gn= 0.5−T−(gn+ 1)
N−1forn = 0,1, . . . , N −1
pt,n=gn+ (t−0.5T+ 0.3 53.4 57.2
I3D + pyramid 53.2 56.7 58.7
I3D + LSTM 48.2 53.1 53.1
I3D + temporal conv 52.8 57.1 58.4
I3D + sub-events 55.5 61.2 61.3
Table 5 shows the average precision for each activity class. Learning temporal structure is particularly
beneficial for frame-based features (e.g., InceptionV3), which capture less temporal information

compared to segment-based features (e.g., I3D). Sub-event learning significantly aids in detecting
localization accuracy, accelerometer data from wearable devices, along with RSSI, can be used to distinguish different activities
(e.g., walking vs. standing). Since some activities are associated with specific rooms (e.g., stirring a pan on the stove is likely to
occur in a kitchen), accelerometer data can enhance RSSI’s ability to differentiate between adjacent rooms, an area where RSSI
alone may be insufficient.
The heterogeneity of PD, where symptoms and their severity vary between patients, poses a challenge for generalizing accelerometer
data across different individuals. Severe symptoms, such as tremors, can introduce bias and accumulated errors in accelerometer data,
