We have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, available
on YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videos
intended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. The
dataset’s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where a
single camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variance
in motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. In
contrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activities
with diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single frame

•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based
on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single
top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of
proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use
of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,
