 Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned
studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in
that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using
the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment
with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single
MTL model on two sets of relations.
3 Task Definition and Dataset
The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs
of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of
our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
this task is influenced by factors such as the label set used and its distribution. For the experiments
detailed in this paper, we utilize a noun-noun compounds dataset that features compounds annotated
with two distinct taxonomies of relations. This means that each noun-noun compound is associated
with two different relations, each based on different linguistic theories. This dataset is derived from
established linguistic resources, including NomBank and the Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT). We chose this dataset for two primary reasons: firstly, the dual annotation of
relations on the same set of compounds is ideal for exploring TL and MTL approaches; secondly,
