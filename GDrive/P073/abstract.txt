The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.

 For instance, the temporal and locative relations in
NomBank (ARGM-TMP and ARGM-LOC, respectively) and their PCEDT counterparts (TWHEN
and LOC) exhibit relatively consistent behavior across frameworks, as they annotate many of the
same compounds. However, some relations that are theoretically similar do not align well in practice.
For example, the functor AIM in PCEDT and the modifier argument ARGM-PNC in NomBank
express a somewhat related semantic concept (purpose), but there is minimal overlap between the
sets of compounds they annotate. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that the semantic similarity
both multi- view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.

7 Conclusion
This report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop
challenge on 3D Food Reconstruction. The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods
by concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective
