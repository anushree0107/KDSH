the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus "shielding" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box
∥(x, y)∥∞<3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with ρ≥2·0.477761 , which is much larger than1
2L≈0.08. In line
with these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by1
Lconverge. In light of this
observation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz

5.1 Methodology
This section details the team’s proposed network, illustrating the step-by-step process from original
images to final mesh models.
5.1.1 Scale factor estimation
 - A modified transformer
encoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforce
dependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoder
to learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacing
the context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposed
network (i.e.
