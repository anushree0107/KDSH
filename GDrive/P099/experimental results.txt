concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the
relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).

Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound
relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For
instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.
Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,
predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center
our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
We have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, available
on YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videos
intended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. The
datasetâ€™s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where a
single camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variance
in motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. In
contrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activities
with diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single frame
