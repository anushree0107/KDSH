Additionally, we compare a bi-directional LSTM with 512 hidden units, using the final hidden state
as input to a fully-connected layer for classification. We frame our tasks as multi-label classification
and train these models to minimize binary cross-entropy:
L(v) =X
czclog(p(c|G(v))) + (1 −zc) log(1 −p(c|G(v)))
where G(v)is the function that pools the temporal information, and zcis the ground truth label for
class c.
5 Activity Detection in Continuous Videos
Detecting activities in continuous videos poses a greater challenge. The goal here is to classify each
frame according to the activities occurring. Unlike segmented videos, continuous videos feature
 The focus of more
recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical
flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been
developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets
such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.
Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity
recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-

Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. It
observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
