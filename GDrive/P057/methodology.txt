 The "majority vote" baseline determines the answer to a
question based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The "weighted vote" baseline,
on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them.
4.2 Neural Network Architecture
A neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generate
a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM
to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question.
The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256
neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenating
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

1 40.06 38.was computed and clipped to [−20,20]. For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames
(8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in
3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adam
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50
epochs.
