 Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

 Inspired by utilizing multihead self-attention, we utilize our DCSA with various kernel lengths with the same
aim: allowing asymmetric long-term learning. The multihead DCSA takes in two inputs ˆx1,ˆx2∈RN×dand yields:
MDCSA k1,...,k n(ˆx1,ˆx2) = Ξ n(φk1,...,k n(ˆx1,ˆx2)) (4)

 They select the best reconstruction results from these methods and
extract the mesh. The extracted mesh is scaled using the estimated scale factor, and optimization
techniques are applied to obtain a refined mesh.
For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction
methods, including Zero123, Zero123++, One2345, ZeroNVS, and DreamGaussian. They choose
ZeroNVS to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution of the input image. The
intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object are used, and an optimization method based
on reprojection error refines the extrinsic parameters of the single camera. Due to limitations in
