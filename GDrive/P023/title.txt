 Next, ICP registration is performed for further alignment, significantly
reducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, gradient descent is used for additional fine-tuning to obtain
the final transformation matrix.
The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models and the ground truths is 0.069441169.

where the parameter βranges from 0 to 1, controlling the negative sample weighting in the contrastive loss. When β= 0, it means
that only intra-group uniformity optimization is performed. Conversely, when β= 1, it means equal treatment of both popular and
unpopular items in terms of their impact on positive samples. The setting of βallows for a flexible adjustment between prioritizing
