generating the refined embedding at time step t, its decision is independent; it does not take into account the actual decision made by
other refined embeddings t. We use a CRF layer to cover just that, i.e., to maximize the probability of the refined embeddings of all
time steps, so it can better model cases where refined embeddings closest to one another must be compatible (i.e., minimizing the
possibility for impossible room transitions). When finding the best sequence of room location Ë†yt, the Viterbi Algorithm is used as a
standard for the CRF layer.
For the second layer, we choose a particular room as a reference and perform a binary classification at each time step t. The binary
noisy estimate of the distance from the wearable to the access point. RSSI signals are not stable; they fluctuate randomly due to
shadowing, fading, and multi-path effects. However, many techniques have been proposed in recent years to tackle these fluctuations
and indirectly improve localization accuracy. Some works utilize deep neural networks (DNN) to generate coarse positioning
estimates from RSSI signals, which are then refined by a hidden Markov model (HMM) to produce a final location estimate. Other
works try to utilize a time series of RSSI data and exploit the temporal connections within each access point to estimate room-level
position. A CNN is used to build localization models to further leverage the temporal dependencies across time-series readings.
