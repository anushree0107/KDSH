explanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be considered
weaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources.
To clarify the terminology used: a "question" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,
"Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?"). Questions have a defined start and
end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the "life" of the question. "Forecasters"
are individuals who provide a "forecast," which consists of a "prediction" and a "justification." The
prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification
is the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction.* When making a prediction on a specific day, is it advantageous to include forecasts from previous
days? (Yes) * Does the accuracy of the prediction improve when considering the question itself
and the written justifications provided with the forecasts? (Yes) * Is it easier to make an accurate
prediction toward the end of a question’s duration? (Yes) * Are written justifications more valuable
when the crowd’s predictions are less accurate? (Yes)
In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with both accurate
and inaccurate forecasts. This analysis aims to identify the features that contribute to a justification
being more or less credible.

The language employed by individuals is indicative of various characteristics.industries as it enables them to anticipate and address potential challenges. This study focuses on
questions spanning the political, economic, and social domains, utilizing forecasts submitted by a
crowd of individuals without specialized training. Each forecast comprises a prediction and a natural
language justification.

The research demonstrates that aggregating the weighted predictions of forecasters is a solid baseline
for calling a question throughout its duration. However, models that incorporate both the question
and the justifications achieve significantly better results, particularly during the first three quartiles of
a question’s life. Importantly, the models developed in this study do not profile individual forecasters
or utilize any information about their identities. This work lays the groundwork for evaluating the
