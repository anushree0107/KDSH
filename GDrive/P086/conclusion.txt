To better comprehend lexical memorizationâ€™s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each
8
relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.

4.2.2 VolETA Results
The team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results
their predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of

the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.
Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"
"help"), "cognition" (e.g., "think," "believe," "know"), and "motion" (e.g.
