 On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,
has received much less attention and is given by:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥ − γ∥F(u)−F(v)∥2.
Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.
Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient
to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of

A small Sub-Gaussian metric between random variables indicates that their values are likely to be
close. To capture the Sub-Gaussian structure of a process, we introduce ε-nets in the Sub-Gaussian
metric. For a given ε >0, these are subsets  ̄Q⊆ ̄Psuch that for every  ̄p∈ ̄P, there is a  ̄q∈ ̄Q
satisfying
 Specifically, there are nonmonotone problems with Stampacchia solutions but
without any Minty solutions.
2.2 Notions of monotonicity
This section aims to revisit some fundamental and more contemporary concepts of monotonicity and the relationships between them.
An operator Fis considered monotone if:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥0.
Such operators naturally arise as the gradients of convex functions, from convex-concave min-max problems, or from equilibrium
problems.
Two frequently studied notions that fall into this category are strongly monotone operators, which satisfy:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥μ∥u−v∥2,
