in the training split (Table 6) and vice versa (Table 7). Table 6 reveals that 80% of the compounds
annotated as TWHEN in PCEDT were annotated as ARGM-TMP in NomBank. Additionally, 47% of
ACT (Actor) relations map to ARG0 (Proto-Agent) in NomBank. While this mapping is not as distinct
as one might hope, it is still relatively high when compared to how other PCEDT relations map to
ARG0. The correspondence matrices also demonstrate that the presumed theoretical similarities
between NomBank and PCEDT relations do not always hold in practice.The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
