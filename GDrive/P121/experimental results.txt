verify adversarial robustness. While Reluplex and other similar techniques can effectively determine
if a network satisfies a given specification, they do not offer a way to guarantee that the network will
meet those specifications. Therefore, additional methods are needed to adjust networks if it is found
that they are not meeting the desired properties.
There has been an increase in techniques for designing networks with certified adversarial robustness,
but enforcing more general safety properties in neural networks is still largely unexplored. One ap-
proach to achieving provably correct neural networks is through abstraction-refinement optimization.
This approach has been applied to the ACAS-Xu dataset, but the network was not guaranteed to meet
 It was observed that a specific parameterization of the von Neumann ratio game exhibits a novel type of solution,
termed "weak Minty," without having any of the previously known characteristics like (negative) comonotonicity or Minty solutions.
Convergence in the presence of such solutions was demonstrated for EG, provided that the extrapolation step size is twice as large as
the update step. Subsequently, it was shown that the condition on the weak Minty parameter can be relaxed by further reducing the
length of the update step, and this is done adaptively. To avoid the need for additional hyperparameters, a backtracking line search is
