 Reluplex has also been used to
verify adversarial robustness. While Reluplex and other similar techniques can effectively determine
if a network satisfies a given specification, they do not offer a way to guarantee that the network will
meet those specifications. Therefore, additional methods are needed to adjust networks if it is found
that they are not meeting the desired properties.
There has been an increase in techniques for designing networks with certified adversarial robustness,
but enforcing more general safety properties in neural networks is still largely unexplored. One ap-
proach to achieving provably correct neural networks is through abstraction-refinement optimization.
This approach has been applied to the ACAS-Xu dataset, but the network was not guaranteed to meet
We define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize the
parameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss
function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from
the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split, with a random seed of 0. The
optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and the number of training
epochs is 500.

The framework proposed here does not require an entirely separate network for each b. In many
applications, it may be advantageous for the constrained predictors to share earlier layers, thus
creating a shared representation of the input space. In addition, our definition of the safe predictor is
general and is not limited to neural networks.
In Appendix B, we show examples of applying our approach to synthetic datasets in 2-D and 3-D
with simple neural networks. These examples show that our safe predictor can enforce arbitrary
input-output specifications using convex output constraints on neural networks, and that the learned
