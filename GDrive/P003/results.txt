of complexity: easy (200 images), medium (30 images), and hard (1 image). A
total of 16 teams participated in the final assessment phase. The methodologies
developed during this challenge have yielded highly encouraging outcomes in
3D food reconstruction, showing great promise for refining portion estimation in
dietary evaluations and nutritional tracking. Further information on this workshop
challenge and the dataset is accessible via the provided URL.
1 Introduction
The convergence of computer vision technologies with culinary practices has pioneered innovative
approaches to dietary monitoring and nutritional assessment. The MetaFood Workshop Challenge
represents a landmark initiative in this emerging field, responding to the pressing demand for precise
and scalable techniques for estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. Such
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.

applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.
