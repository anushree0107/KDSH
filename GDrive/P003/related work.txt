Gait quantification using wearables or smartphones is an area where a significant amount of work has been done. Cameras can
also detect parkinsonian gait and some gait features, including step length and average walking speed. Time-of-flight devices,
which measure distances between the subject and the camera, have been used to assess medication adherence through gait analysis.
From free-living data, one approach to gait and room use evaluation in home settings is by emitting and detecting radio waves to
non-invasively track movement. Gait analysis using radio wave technology shows promise to track disease progression, severity, and
medication response. However, this approach cannot identify who is doing the movement and also suffers from technical issues
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

diet.
By concentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food derived from various visual
inputs, including multiple views and single perspectives, this challenge endeavors to bridge the
disparity between current methodologies and practical needs. It promotes the creation of unique
solutions capable of managing the intricacies of food morphology, texture, and illumination, while also
meeting the real-world demands of dietary evaluation. This initiative gathers experts from computer
vision, machine learning, and nutrition science to propel 3D food reconstruction technologies forward.
These advancements have the potential to substantially enhance the precision and utility of food
