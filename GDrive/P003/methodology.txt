 This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.
To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR
i}n
i=1, and
food object masks {MF
i}n
i=1. This step, denoted as {IR
i}n
i=1, integrates various data sources into a
unified format for further processing.
The team converts the RGBA images {IR
i}n
i=1and camera poses {Cj}k
j=1into meaningful metadata
and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.
The modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based
on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single
top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of
proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use
of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,
