4.3 Multihead Dual Convolutional Self-Attention
Our approach employs a self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies across time steps. It is embedded as part of the
DCSA architecture.The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
to utilize a recurrent neural network such as a long-short term memory (LSTM) approach. However, in LSTM layers, the local
context is summarized based on the previous context and the current input. Two similar patterns separated by a long period of time
might have different contexts if they are processed by the LSTM layers. We utilize a combination of causal convolution layers and
self-attention layers, which we name Dual Convolutional Self-Attention (DCSA). The DCSA takes in a primary input ˆx1∈RN×d
and a secondary input ˆx2∈RN×dand yields:
