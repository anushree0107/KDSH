 We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
one of the feature pooling methods, and zt,cis the ground truth class at time t.
A method to learn ’super-events’ (i.e., global video context) has been introduced and shown to be
effective for activity detection in continuous videos. This approach involves learning a set of temporal
structure filters modeled as NCauchy distributions. Each distribution is defined by a center xnand a
width γn. Given the video length T, the filters are constructed by:
xn=(T−1)(tanh( x′
n) + 1)

This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi-
ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition or
detection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activities
are often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scene
structure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. This
study compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities in
segmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams.

The field of activity recognition has garnered substantial attention in computer vision research. Initial
successes were achieved with hand-engineered features such as dense trajectories.
