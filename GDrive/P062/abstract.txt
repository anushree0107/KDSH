but the label sets are distinct.
For clarity, we differentiate between transfer learning and multi-task learning in this paper, despite
these terms sometimes being used interchangeably in the literature. We define TL as the utilization of
parameters from a model trained on Ta to initialize another model for Tb. In contrast, MTL involves
training parts of the same model to learn both Ta and Tb, essentially learning one set of parameters
for both tasks. The concept is to train a single model simultaneously on both tasks, where one task
introduces an inductive bias that aids the model in generalizing over the main task. It is important to
Mbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental.
1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples. Furthermore, we introduce a modified
version of EG that incorporates an adaptive step size, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the problemâ€™s
specific parameters.
1 Introduction
The recent advancements in machine learning models, particularly those that can be formulated as min-max optimization problems,
have generated significant interest in saddle point problems. Examples of these models include generative adversarial networks,
adversarial learning frameworks, adversarial example games, and actor-critic methods. While practical methods have been developed
that generally perform well, the theoretical understanding of scenarios where the objective function is nonconvex in the minimization
component and nonconcave in the maximization component remains limited, with some research even suggesting intractability in
certain cases.
