 Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned
studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in
that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using
the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment
with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single
MTL model on two sets of relations.

The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs
of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of

Interpreting Noun-Noun Compounds
Abstract
This study examines the effectiveness of transfer learning and multi-task learning
in the context of a complex semantic classification problem: understanding the
meaning of noun-noun compounds. Through a series of detailed experiments and
an in-depth analysis of errors, we demonstrate that employing transfer learning by
initializing parameters and multi-task learning through parameter sharing enables a
neural classification model to better generalize across a dataset characterized by a
highly uneven distribution of semantic relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate
how utilizing dual annotations, which involve two distinct sets of relations applied
to the same compounds, can enhance the overall precision of a neural classifier and
The application of transfer and multi-task learning in natural language processing has gained sig-
nificant traction, yet considerable ambiguity persists regarding the effectiveness of particular task
characteristics and experimental setups. This research endeavors to clarify the benefits of TL and
MTL in the context of semantic interpretation of noun-noun compounds. By executing a sequence of
minimally contrasting experiments and conducting thorough analysis of results and prediction errors,
we demonstrate how both TL and MTL can mitigate the effects of class imbalance and drastically
enhance predictions for low-frequency relations. Overall, our TL, and particularly our MTL models,
are better at making predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the improvements are
