Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.

use in safety-critical machine learning systems, demonstrating it on an aircraft collision avoidance
problem. The novelty of our approach is its simplicity and guaranteed enforcement of specifications
through combinations of convex output constraints during all stages of training. Future work includes
adapting and using techniques from optimization and control barrier functions, as well as incorporating
notions of adversarial robustness into our design, such as extending the work to bound the Lipschitz
constant of our networks.
Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 2.1
Proof. Fixiand assume that x∈Ai. It follows that σi(x) = 0 , so for all b∈Owhere bi= 0,
suming the NeuRIPs event, we then provide bounds on the expected risk, applicable
to networks within any sublevel set of the empirical risk. Our results show that all
networks with sufficiently small empirical risk achieve uniform generalization.
1 Introduction
A fundamental requirement of any scientific model is a clear evaluation of its limitations. In recent
years, supervised machine learning has seen the development of tools for automated model discovery
from training data. However, these methods often lack a robust theoretical framework to estimate
model limitations. Statistical learning theory quantifies the limitation of a trained model by the
generalization error. This theory uses concepts such as the VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity
to analyze generalization error bounds for classification problems.
