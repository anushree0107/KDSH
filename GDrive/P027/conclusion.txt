our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
trained by Fares et al. (2017). If a word is not found during lookup in the embedding model, we
check if the word is uppercased and attempt to find the lowercase version. For hyphenated words
not found in the embedding vocabulary, we split the word at the hyphen and average the vectors of
its parts, if they are present in the vocabulary. If the word remains unrepresented after these steps, a
designated vector for unknown words is employed.
5.1.1 Architecture and Hyperparameters
Our selection of hyperparameters is informed by multiple rounds of experimentation with the single-
task learning model, as well as the choices made by prior work. The weights of the embedding layer
In computational linguistics, noun-noun compound interpretation is typically treated as an automatic
classification task. Various machine learning (ML) algorithms and models, such as Maximum
Entropy, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, have been employed to decipher the
semantics of nominal compounds. These models utilize information from lexical semantics, like
WordNet-based features, and distributional semantics, such as word embeddings. However, noun-
noun compound interpretation remains a challenging NLP problem due to the high productivity
of noun-noun compounding as a linguistic structure and the difficulty in deriving the semantics of
noun-noun compounds from their constituents. Our research contributes to advancing NLP research
