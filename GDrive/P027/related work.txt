our attention on methods that frame the interpretation problem as a classification task involving a
fixed, predetermined set of relations. Various machine learning models have been applied to this
task, including nearest neighbor classifiers that use semantic similarity based on lexical resources,
kernel-based methods like SVMs that utilize lexical and relational features, Maximum Entropy
models that incorporate a wide range of lexical and surface form features, and neural networks that
rely on word embeddings or combine word embeddings with path embeddings. Among these studies,
some have utilized the same dataset. To our knowledge, TL and MTL have not been previously
applied to compound interpretation. Therefore, we review prior research on TL and MTL in other
NLP tasks.
layers: 1) an input layer, 2) an embedding layer, 3) a hidden layer, and 4) an output layer. The input

layer consists of two integers that indicate the indices of a compound’s constituents in the embedding
layer, where the word embedding vectors are stored. These selected vectors are then passed to a fully
connected hidden layer, the size of which matches the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors.
Finally, a softmax function is applied to the output layer to select the most probable relation.
The compound’s constituents are represented using a 300-dimensional word embedding model trained
on an English Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword Fifth Edition. The embedding model was
determines a recommender system’s effectiveness by precisely capturing the interplay between user interests and item features.
Recent studies emphasize two fundamental principles in representation learning: alignment and uniformity. The alignment principle
ensures that embeddings of similar or related items (or users) are closely clustered together, improving the system’s ability to
recommend items that align with a user’s interests. This principle is crucial when accurately reflecting user preferences through
corresponding item characteristics. Conversely, the uniformity principle ensures a balanced distribution of all embeddings across the
representation space. This approach prevents the over-concentration of embeddings in specific areas, enhancing recommendation
diversity and improving generalization to unseen data.
