the re-weighting contrastive loss of popular items is removed, focusing instead on optimizing the consistency of representations for
unpopular items. Similarly, PAAC-w/o U denotes the removal of the re-weighting contrastive loss for unpopular items. PAAC-w/o
A refers to the variant without the popularity-aware supervised alignment loss. It’s worth noting that PAAC-w/o A differs from

Table 1: Performance comparison on three public datasets with K = 20. The best performance is indicated in bold, while the
second-best performance is underlined. The superscripts * indicate p ≤0.05 for the paired t-test of PAAC vs.For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating
SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited
keypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.
In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which
employs a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion

and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to
produce a dense point cloud.
During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline
