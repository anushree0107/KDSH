For Structure from Motion (SfM), the team enhanced the advanced COLMAP method by integrating
SuperPoint and SuperGlue techniques. This integration significantly addressed the issue of limited
keypoints in scenes with minimal texture, as illustrated in Figure 15.
In the mesh reconstruction phase, the team’s approach builds upon 2D Gaussian Splatting, which
employs a differentiable 2D Gaussian renderer and includes regularization terms for depth distortion

and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) results are utilized to
produce a dense point cloud.
During post-processing, the team applied filtering and outlier removal methods, identified the outline

high-quality frames. This involves applying a Gaussian blurring kernel followed by the fast Fourier
transform method. Near-Image Similarity uses perceptual hashing and Hamming distance threshold-
ing to detect similar images and retain overlapping ones. Duplicates and blurry images are excluded
to maintain data integrity and accuracy.

 The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an
average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.
The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will
perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art
model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,
