a common aspect of the aforementioned studies is that their bounds are contingent on the error of the score estimator. According to
some, providing precise guarantees for the estimation of the score function is challenging, as it necessitates an understanding of the
non-convex training dynamics of neural network optimization, which is currently beyond reach. Therefore, upper bounds are derived
without making assumptions about the learned score function. Instead, the bound presented here is dependent on a reconstruction
loss calculated over a finite independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample. Intuitively, a loss function is defined, which
quantifies the average Euclidean distance between a sample from the data-generating distribution and the reconstruction obtained by
Mbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental.
1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the modelâ€™s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
