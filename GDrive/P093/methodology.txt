 The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an
average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.
The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will
perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art
model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,

are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the modelâ€™s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
