medication state prediction and maintain their performance across all cross-validations thanks to the addition of Eq. 13 in the loss

**Limitations and future research:** One limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size (which was planned as this is
an exploratory pilot study). We believe our sample size is ample to show proof of concept. This is also the first such work with
unobtrusive ground truth validation from embedded cameras. Future work should validate our approach further on a large cohort
of people with PD and consider stratifying for sub-groups within PD (e.g., akinetic-rigid or tremor-dominant phenotypes), which
 The improvement is more significant in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations, when the training data are limited, with an
average improvement of almost 9% for the F1-score over the alternative to the state-of-the-art model.
The LOO-HC and LOO-PD validations show that a model that has the ability to capture the temporal dynamics across time steps will
perform better than a standard baseline technique such as a Random Forest. The modified transformer encoder and the state-of-the-art
model perform better in those two validations due to their ability to capture asynchronous relations across modalities. However,
 The MDCSA network has all the capabilities that the state-of-the-art model has,
with an improvement in suppressing the accelerometer modality when needed via the GRN layer embedded in DCSA. Suppressing
the noisy modality seems to have a strong impact on maintaining the performance of the network when the training data is limited.
This is validated by how the alternative to the state-of-the-art model (i.e., the state-of-the-art model with added GRN and CRF
layers) outperforms the standard state-of-the-art model by an average of 2.2% for the F1-score in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations.
