We have compiled an extensive dataset from 20 baseball games of the 2017 MLB postseason, available
on YouTube, totaling over 42 hours of video. Our dataset includes two main parts: segmented videos
intended for activity recognition and continuous videos designed for activity classification. The
datasetâ€™s complexity is amplified by the fact that it originates from televised baseball games, where a
single camera perspective is shared among various activities. Additionally, there is minimal variance
in motion and appearance among different activities, such as swinging a bat versus bunting. In
contrast to datasets like THUMOS and ActivityNet, which encompass a broad spectrum of activities
with diverse settings, scales, and camera angles, our dataset features activities where a single frame
 Utilizing the 60fps rate available in YouTube videos, we
recalculated optical flow and extracted RGB frames at this higher rate. Employing a fully-connected
layer with a single output for pitch speed prediction and minimizing the L1 loss between predicted
and actual speeds, we achieved an average error of 3.6mph. Table 6 compares different models, and
Fig. 8 illustrates the sub-events learned for various speeds.

This paper introduces MLB-YouTube, a novel dataset that includes densely annotated frames of activi-
ties extracted from broadcast baseball videos. Unlike many current datasets for activity recognition or
detection, our dataset emphasizes fine-grained activity recognition. The differences between activities
are often minimal, primarily involving the movement of a single individual, with a consistent scene
structure across activities. The determination of activity is based on a single camera perspective. This
study compares various methods for temporal feature aggregation, both for classifying activities in
segmented videos and for detecting them in continuous video streams.
