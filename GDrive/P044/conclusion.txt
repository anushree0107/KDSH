would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart homeâ€™s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
approaches struggle with diverse food shapes, depth camera methods need specialized hardware,
and deep learning approaches lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution samples. 3D
reconstruction offers a promising solution by providing comprehensive spatial information, adapting
to various shapes, potentially working with single images, offering visually interpretable results,
and enabling a standardized approach to food portion estimation. These benefits motivated the
organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge, aiming to overcome existing limitations and

impacting nutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.
