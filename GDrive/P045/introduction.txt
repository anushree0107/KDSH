but the label sets are distinct.
For clarity, we differentiate between transfer learning and multi-task learning in this paper, despite
these terms sometimes being used interchangeably in the literature. We define TL as the utilization of
parameters from a model trained on Ta to initialize another model for Tb. In contrast, MTL involves
training parts of the same model to learn both Ta and Tb, essentially learning one set of parameters
for both tasks. The concept is to train a single model simultaneously on both tasks, where one task
introduces an inductive bias that aids the model in generalizing over the main task. It is important to
in the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especially
since the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks.
4 Transfer vs. Multi-Task Learning
In this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) to
articulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be described
in terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the input
feature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task is
defined by X, P(X).A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of the
domain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that
TL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relations
within a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularly
well-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when applied
to the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in a
