is a 1D-convolutional layer with a kernel size {1, k}and a stride
of 1,WK∈Rd×d, WQ∈Rd×d, WV∈Rd×dare weights for keys, queries, and values of the self-attention layer, and dis the
embedding dimension. Note that all weights for GRN are shared across each time step t.

4.3 Multihead Dual Convolutional Self-Attention
Our approach employs a self-attention mechanism to capture global dependencies across time steps. It is embedded as part of the
DCSA architecture. We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
sequential processing of video features, whereas other methods can be fully parallelized.
