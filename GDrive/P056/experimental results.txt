and cocoercive operators, which fulfill:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥β∥F(u)−F(v)∥2. (2)
Strongly monotone operators emerge as gradients of strongly convex functions or in strongly-convex-strongly-concave min-max
problems. Cocoercive operators appear, for instance, as gradients of smooth convex functions, in which case (2) holds with βequal
to the inverse of the gradient’s Lipschitz constant.
Departing from monotonicity. Both of the aforementioned subclasses of monotonicity can serve as starting points for exploring
the non-monotone domain. Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and
spurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and
foremost is the extensively studied setting of ν-weak monotonicity:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥ − ν∥u−v∥2.
Such operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it
includes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this
property. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,
has received much less attention and is given by:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥ − γ∥F(u)−F(v)∥2.
Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.
Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient
to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of
