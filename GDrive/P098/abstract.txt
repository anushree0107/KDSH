Participants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 distinct food items from 2D images, mim-
icking scenarios where mobile devices equipped with depth-sensing cameras are used for dietary

recording and nutritional tracking. The challenge was segmented into three tiers of difficulty based
on the number of images provided: approximately 200 images for easy, 30 for medium, and a single
top-view image for hard. This design aimed to rigorously test the adaptability and resilience of
proposed solutions under various realistic conditions. A notable feature of this challenge was the use
of a visible checkerboard for physical referencing and the provision of depth images for each frame,
would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart homeâ€™s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
