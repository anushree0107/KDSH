the accuracy of our predictor remains the same as the unconstrained network, demonstrating we are
not losing accuracy to achieve safety guarantees.

4 Discussion and Future Work
We propose an approach for designing a safe predictor that adheres to input-output specifications for
credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do
not require tracking individual forecasters.

C.1 Safeability Constraints
The "safeability" property, originally introduced and used to verify the safety of the VerticalCAS
neural networks can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The "safeable region" for
a given advisory represents input locations where that advisory can be selected such that future
advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the advisory is "unsafeable"
and the corresponding input region is the "unsafeable region". Examples of these regions, and their
proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory.
