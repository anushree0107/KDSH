questions spanning the political, economic, and social domains, utilizing forecasts submitted by a
crowd of individuals without specialized training. Each forecast comprises a prediction and a natural
language justification.

The research demonstrates that aggregating the weighted predictions of forecasters is a solid baseline
for calling a question throughout its duration. However, models that incorporate both the question
and the justifications achieve significantly better results, particularly during the first three quartiles of
a questionâ€™s life. Importantly, the models developed in this study do not profile individual forecasters
or utilize any information about their identities. This work lays the groundwork for evaluating the
However, none of these prior works have specifically aimed to call questions throughout their entire
duration.

The research utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, and
individuals submit their forecasts. The questions primarily revolve around geopolitics, encompassing
areas such as domestic and international politics, the economy, and social matters. For this study, all
binary questions were collected, along with their associated forecasts, each comprising a prediction
and a justification. In total, the dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submitted
over 32,708 days. This dataset significantly expands upon previous research, nearly doubling the
number of forecasts analyzed.large groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. If
not, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individual
judgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom.
This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and social
domains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, and
a written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identical
predictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliability
of the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source without
