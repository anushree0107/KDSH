 Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,
concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer

data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previous
work that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binary
classifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.

 Conversely, SGMs
employ score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating new
samples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varying
noise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the score
function for all noise levels has been proposed.
Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the score
function, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) has been derived.Generalization in ReLU Networks via Restricted
Isometry and Norm Concentration
Abstract
Regression tasks, while aiming to model relationships across the entire input space,
are often constrained by limited training data. Nevertheless, if the hypothesis func-
tions can be represented effectively by the data, there is potential for identifying a
model that generalizes well. This paper introduces the Neural Restricted Isometry
Property (NeuRIPs), which acts as a uniform concentration event that ensures all
shallow ReLU networks are sketched with comparable quality. To determine the
sample complexity necessary to achieve NeuRIPs, we bound the covering numbers
of the networks using the Sub-Gaussian metric and apply chaining techniques. As-
