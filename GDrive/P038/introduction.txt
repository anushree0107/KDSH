applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

1 40.06 38. Later, various processes are done to further extract correlations across modalities through the use of various layers (e.g.,
concatenation, CNN layer, transformer, self-attention). Our work is inspired by prior research where we only utilize accelerometer

data to enrich the RSSI, instead of utilizing all IMU sensors, in order to reduce battery consumption. In addition, unlike previous
work that stops at predicting room locations, we go a step further and use room-to-room transition behaviors as features for a binary
classifier predicting whether people with PD are taking their medications or withholding them.

 Another intriguing observation was made, where for cohypomonotone problems, a monotonically decreasing gradient
norm was demonstrated when using EG. However, we did not observe this in our experiments, emphasizing the need to differentiate
this class from problems with weak Minty solutions.

Interaction dominance. The concept of α-interaction dominance for nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems was investigated,
and it was shown that the proximal-point method converges sublinearly if this condition is met in yand linearly if it is met in both
components. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if a problem is interaction dominant in both components, it is also negatively
comonotone.
Optimism.
