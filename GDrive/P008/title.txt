but the label sets are distinct.
For clarity, we differentiate between transfer learning and multi-task learning in this paper, despite
these terms sometimes being used interchangeably in the literature. We define TL as the utilization of
parameters from a model trained on Ta to initialize another model for Tb. In contrast, MTL involves
training parts of the same model to learn both Ta and Tb, essentially learning one set of parameters
for both tasks. The concept is to train a single model simultaneously on both tasks, where one task
introduces an inductive bias that aids the model in generalizing over the main task. It is important to
and MTL models are trained using the same hyperparameters as the STL model.
5.2 Transfer Learning Models
In our experiments, transfer learning involves training an STL model on PCEDT relations and then
using some of its weights to initialize another model for NomBank relations. Given the neural
classifier architecture detailed in Section 5.1, we identify three ways to implement TL: 1) TLE:
Transferring the embedding layer weights, 2) TLH: Transferring the hidden layer weights, and 3)
TLEH: Transferring both the embedding and hidden layer weights. Furthermore, we differentiate
between transfer learning from PCEDT to NomBank and vice versa. This results in six setups,
in the label sets, where it exists, can be leveraged through transfer and multi-task learning, especially
since the overall distribution of relations differs between the two frameworks.
4 Transfer vs. Multi-Task Learning
In this section, we employ the terminology and definitions established by Pan and Yang (2010) to
articulate our framework for transfer and multi-task learning. Our classification task can be described
in terms of all training pairs (X, Y) and a probability distribution P(X), where X represents the input
feature space, Y denotes the set of all labels, and N is the training data size. The domain of a task is
defined by X, P(X).
