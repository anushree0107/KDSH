 Utilizing the 60fps rate available in YouTube videos, we
recalculated optical flow and extracted RGB frames at this higher rate. Employing a fully-connected
layer with a single output for pitch speed prediction and minimizing the L1 loss between predicted
and actual speeds, we achieved an average error of 3.6mph. Table 6 compares different models, and
Fig. 8 illustrates the sub-events learned for various speeds.

Method Two-stream
I3D 4.3 mph
I3D + LSTM 4.1 mph
I3D + sub-events 3.9 mph
In practice, large batch sizes of order O(ε−1)are typically not desirable; instead, a small or decreasing step size is preferred. In the
weak Minty setting, this causes additional trouble due to the necessity of large step sizes to guarantee convergence. Unfortunately,
the current analysis does not allow for variable γ.
4 EG+ with adaptive step sizes
In this section, we present Algorithm 3, which is able to solve the previously mentioned problems without any knowledge of the
Lipschitz constant L, as it is typically difficult to compute in practice. Additionally, it is well known that rough estimates will lead to
small step sizes and slow convergence behavior.on accuracy scores is inadequate for evaluating the effectiveness of TL and MTL for this task and
dataset.
Secondly, with the exception of the MTLF model, all TL and MTL models consistently improve
the F1 score for all PCEDT relations except PAT. Notably, the F1 scores for the relations TWHEN
and ACT show a substantial increase compared to other PCEDT relations when only the embedding
layer’s weights are shared (MTLE) or transferred (TLE). This outcome can be partially understood
by examining the correspondence matrices between NomBank arguments and PCEDT functors,
presented in Tables 7 and 6.
