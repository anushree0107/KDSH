 However, since
these improvements are relatively minor, we further analyze the results to understand if and how TL
and MTL are beneficial.
7 Results Analysis
This section provides a detailed analysis of the models’ performance, drawing on insights from the
dataset and the classification errors made by the models. The discussion in the following sections is
primarily based on the results from the test split, as it is larger than the development split.
7.1 Relation Distribution
To illustrate the complexity of the task, we depict the distribution of the most frequent relations in
NomBank and PCEDT across the three data splits in Figure 1. Notably, approximately 71.18% of the
4m-PDMDCSA 4APS RSSI 58.59 (23.60) 57.68 (24.27)
MDCSA 4APS 62.36 (18.98) 57.76 (20.07)
MDCSA 70.47 (14.10) 64.64 (21.38)
Table 3: Room-to-room transition accuracy (in seconds) of all models compared to the ground truth. Standard deviation is shown in
(.), the best performer is bold, while the second best is italicized. A model that fails to capture a transition between particular rooms
within a period that has the ground truth is assigned ’N/A’ score.
