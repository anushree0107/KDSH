whether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications.

Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.

 Since the objective is to accurately call questions throughout their
entire duration, all forecasts with written justifications are included, regardless of factors such as
justification length or the number of forecasts submitted by a single forecaster. Additionally, this
approach prioritizes privacy, as no information about the individual forecasters is utilized.

or more named entities, and are open for over one month.
