A particularly difficult min-max toy example with a "Forsaken" solution was proposed and is given by:
min
x∈Rmax
y∈Rx(y−0.45) + φ(x)−φ(y), (6)
where φ(z) =1
6z6−2
4z4+1
4z2−1
2z. This problem exhibits a Stampacchia solution at (x∗, y∗)≈(0.08,0.4), but also two limit
cycles not containing any critical point of the objective function. In addition, it was also observed that the limit cycle closer to
 It offers a generalization of monotonicity, but in a direction distinct from the concept of Minty
solutions, and only a limited number of studies have examined methods in this context. An anchored version of EG was studied, and
an improved convergence rate of O(1/k2)(in terms of the squared operator norm) was shown. Similarly, an accelerated version of
the reflected gradient method was investigated. Whether such acceleration is possible in the more general setting of weak Minty
solutions remains an open question (any Stampacchia solution to the VI given by a negatively comonotone operator is a weak Minty
solution).the solution repels possible trajectories of iterates, thus "shielding" the solution. Later, it was noticed that, restricted to the box
∥(x, y)∥∞<3, the above-mentioned solution is weak Minty with ρ≥2·0.477761 , which is much larger than1
2L≈0.08. In line
with these observations, we can see that none of the fixed step size methods with a step size bounded by1
Lconverge. In light of this
observation, a backtracking linesearch was proposed, which potentially allows for larger steps than predicted by the global Lipschitz
constant.
