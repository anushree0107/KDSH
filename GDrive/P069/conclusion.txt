•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

6.2.3 Pitch Type Classification
We conducted experiments to determine the feasibility of predicting pitch types from video, a task
made challenging by pitchers’ efforts to disguise their pitches from batters and the subtle differences
between pitches, such as grip and rotation. We incorporated pose data extracted using OpenPose,
utilizing heatmaps of joint and body part locations as input to a newly trained InceptionV3 CNN.
Pose features were considered due to variations in body mechanics between different pitches. Our
dataset includes six pitch types, with results presented in Table 7.
