applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

layer consists of two integers that indicate the indices of a compound’s constituents in the embedding
layer, where the word embedding vectors are stored. These selected vectors are then passed to a fully
connected hidden layer, the size of which matches the dimensionality of the word embedding vectors.
Finally, a softmax function is applied to the output layer to select the most probable relation.
The compound’s constituents are represented using a 300-dimensional word embedding model trained
on an English Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword Fifth Edition. The embedding model was
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
