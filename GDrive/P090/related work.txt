are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the modelâ€™s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
and MTL models are trained using the same hyperparameters as the STL model.
5.2 Transfer Learning Models
In our experiments, transfer learning involves training an STL model on PCEDT relations and then
using some of its weights to initialize another model for NomBank relations. Given the neural
classifier architecture detailed in Section 5.1, we identify three ways to implement TL: 1) TLE:
Transferring the embedding layer weights, 2) TLH: Transferring the hidden layer weights, and 3)
TLEH: Transferring both the embedding and hidden layer weights. Furthermore, we differentiate
between transfer learning from PCEDT to NomBank and vice versa. This results in six setups,
 The focus of more
recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical
flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been
developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets
such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.
Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity
recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-
.
Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and max-pooling across entire videos yielded the best outcomes. It
