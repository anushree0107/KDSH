1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models: A Quantitative Analysis
Abstract
Deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, are a significant family within deep learning. This study
provides a precise upper limit for the Wasserstein distance between a learned distribution by a diffusion model
and the target distribution. In contrast to earlier research, this analysis does not rely on presumptions regarding
the learned score function. Furthermore, the findings are applicable to any data-generating distributions within
restricted instance spaces, even those lacking a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and the upper limit is not
exponentially dependent on the ambient space dimension. The primary finding expands upon recent research by
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.
