 The "majority vote" baseline determines the answer to a
question based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The "weighted vote" baseline,
on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them.
4.2 Neural Network Architecture
A neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generate
a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM
to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question.
The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256
neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenating
has been discovered that pooling intervals from varying locations and durations is advantageous for
activity recognition. It was demonstrated that identifying and classifying key sub-event intervals can
lead to better performance.
Recently, segment-based 3D CNNs have been employed to capture spatio-temporal data concurrently
for activity detection. These methods depend on the 3D CNN to capture temporal dynamics, which
typically span only 16 frames. Although longer-term temporal structures have been explored, this was
usually accomplished with temporal pooling of localized features or (spatio-)temporal convolutions
with extended fixed intervals. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been applied to represent
transitions in activity between frames.

 The focus of more
recent studies has shifted towards the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
activity recognition. Two-stream CNN architectures utilize both spatial RGB frames and optical
flow frames. To capture spatio-temporal characteristics, 3D XYT convolutional models have been
developed. The development of these advanced CNN models has been supported by large datasets
such as Kinetics, THUMOS, and ActivityNet.
Several studies have investigated the aggregation of temporal features for the purpose of activity
recognition. Research has compared several pooling techniques and determined that both Long Short-
