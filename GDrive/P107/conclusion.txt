Proof sketch. (Complete proof in Appendix E) We first define and decompose the excess risk by
E( ̄q, ̄p∗) :=∥φ ̄q−y∥2
μ− ∥φ ̄p∗−y∥2
When the NeuRIPs event occurs, the function norm || · || μ, which is related to the expected risk, is
close to || · || m, which corresponds to the empirical risk. Motivated by this property, we aim to find
a shallow ReLU network φ ̄pwith small expected risk by solving the empirical risk minimization
problem:

m.
Since the set Φ ̄Pof shallow ReLU networks is non-convex, this minimization cannot be solved
with efficient convex optimizers. Therefore, instead of analyzing only the solution φ∗
