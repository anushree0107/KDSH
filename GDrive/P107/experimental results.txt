provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an oxâ€™s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.
In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from
large groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. If
not, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individual
judgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom.
This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and social
domains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, and
a written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identical
predictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliability
of the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source without
sample, there will be a corresponding demographic feature data sample that is used to train a different binary classifier to predict
whether a person with PD is ON or OFF medications.
