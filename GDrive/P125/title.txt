semantic dependency parsing in PCEDT and NomBank. Future research will focus on incorporating
additional natural language processing tasks defined using these frameworks to understand noun-noun
compound interpretation using TL and MTL.

the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.
Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"
"help"), "cognition" (e.g., "think," "believe," "know"), and "motion" (e.g.To better comprehend lexical memorizationâ€™s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each
8
relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
