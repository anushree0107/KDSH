Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.

would also increase the generalizability of the results to the wider population. Future work in this matter could also include the
construction of a semi-synthetic dataset based on collected data to facilitate a parallel and large-scale evaluation.
This smart homeâ€™s layout and parameters remain constant for all the participants, and we acknowledge that the transfer of this deep
learning model to other varied home settings may introduce variations in localization accuracy. For future ecological validation and
based on our current results, we anticipate the need for pre-training (e.g., a brief walkaround which is labeled) for each home, and
also suggest that some small amount of ground-truth data will need to be collected (e.g., researcher prompting of study participants to
Each pair consists of one person with PD and one healthy control volunteer (HC). This pairing was chosen to enable PD vs. HC
comparison, for safety reasons, and also to increase the naturalistic social behavior (particularly amongst the spousal pairs who
already lived together). From the 24 participants, five females and seven males have PD. The average age of the participants is 60.25
(PD 61.25, Control 59.25), and the average time since PD diagnosis for the person with PD is 11.3 years (range 0.5-19).
To measure the accuracy of the machine learning models, wall-mounted cameras are installed on the ground floor of the house,
