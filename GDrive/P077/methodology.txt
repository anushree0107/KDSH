26% of right constituents of compounds annotated as AIM occur
in other compounds annotated as RSTR. This explains the modelsâ€™ inability to learn AIM but raises
questions about their ability to learn relational representations, which we explore further in Section
7.3.

can we incorporate these extra features (and modalities) into the existing features for accurate room predictions, particularly in the
context of PD where the acceleration signal may be significantly impacted by the disease itself?
(2) Modeling local and global temporal dynamics. The true correlations between inputs both intra-modality (i.e., RSSI signal among
access points) and inter-modality (i.e., RSSI signal against accelerometer fluctuation) are dynamic. These dynamics can affect one
another within a local context (e.g., cyclical patterns) or across long-term relationships.
