 This ensures consistent reference object identification throughout the dataset.
To create RGBA images, the team combines RGB images, reference object masks {MR
i}n
i=1, and
food object masks {MF
i}n
i=1. This step, denoted as {IR
i}n
i=1, integrates various data sources into a
unified format for further processing.
The team converts the RGBA images {IR
i}n
i=1and camera poses {Cj}k
j=1into meaningful metadata
and modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates accurate scene reconstruction.
The modeled data Dmis input into NeuS2 for mesh reconstruction. NeuS2 generates colorful meshes
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.

1 40.06 38.Hamming distance for near image similarity was set to 12. For Gaussian kernel radius, even numbers
in the range [0...30] were used for detecting blurry images. The diameter for removing isolated pieces
was set to 5%. NeuS2 was run for 15,000 iterations with a mesh resolution of 512x512, a unit cube
"aabb scale" of 1, "scale" of 0.15, and "offset" of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] for each food scene.
