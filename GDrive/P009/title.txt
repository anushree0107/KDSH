credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do
not require tracking individual forecasters.

 This approach has been demonstrated as a state-of-the-art
method for alleviating popularity bias. It employs data augmentation techniques such as graph augmentation or feature
augmentation to generate different views, maximizing positive pair consistency and minimizing negative pair consistency
to promote more uniform representations. Specifically, Adap- τadjusts user/item embeddings to specific values, while
SimGCL integrates InfoNCE loss to enhance representation uniformity and alleviate popularity bias.
4.2 Representation Learning for CF
Representation learning is crucial in recommendation systems, especially in modern collaborative filtering (CF) techniques. It
creates personalized embeddings that capture user preferences and item characteristics. The quality of these representations critically
 Intuitively, items interacted with by the same user have
some similar characteristics. In this section, we utilize common supervisory signals in popular item representations and suggest a
popularity-aware supervised alignment method to improve the representations of unpopular items.
We initially filter items with similar characteristics based on the user’s interests. For any user, we define the set of items they interact
with. We count the frequency of each item appearing in the training dataset as its popularity. Subsequently, we group items based on
their relative popularity. We divide items into two groups: the popular item group and the unpopular item group. The popularity of
each item in the popular group is higher than that of any item in the unpopular group.
