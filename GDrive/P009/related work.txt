Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Models: A Quantitative Analysis
Abstract
Deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, are a significant family within deep learning. This study
provides a precise upper limit for the Wasserstein distance between a learned distribution by a diffusion model
and the target distribution. In contrast to earlier research, this analysis does not rely on presumptions regarding
the learned score function. Furthermore, the findings are applicable to any data-generating distributions within
restricted instance spaces, even those lacking a density relative to the Lebesgue measure, and the upper limit is not
exponentially dependent on the ambient space dimension. The primary finding expands upon recent research by
suming the NeuRIPs event, we then provide bounds on the expected risk, applicable
to networks within any sublevel set of the empirical risk. Our results show that all
networks with sufficiently small empirical risk achieve uniform generalization.
1 Introduction
A fundamental requirement of any scientific model is a clear evaluation of its limitations. In recent
years, supervised machine learning has seen the development of tools for automated model discovery
from training data. However, these methods often lack a robust theoretical framework to estimate
model limitations. Statistical learning theory quantifies the limitation of a trained model by the
generalization error. This theory uses concepts such as the VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity
to analyze generalization error bounds for classification problems. Conversely, SGMs
employ score-matching methods to approximate the score function of the data-generating distribution, subsequently generating new
samples through Langevin dynamics. Recognizing that real-world distributions might lack a defined score function, adding varying
noise levels to training samples to encompass the entire instance space and training a neural network to concurrently learn the score
function for all noise levels has been proposed.
Although DDPMs and SGMs may initially seem distinct, it has been demonstrated that DDPMs implicitly approximate the score
function, with the sampling process resembling Langevin dynamics. Moreover, a unified perspective of both methods using stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) has been derived.
