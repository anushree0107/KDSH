Despite their relative simplicity, the baseline methods achieve commendable results, demonstrating
that aggregating forecaster predictions without considering the question or justifications is a viable
strategy. However, the full neural network achieves significantly improved results.
**Using Daily or Active Forecasts** Incorporating active forecasts, rather than solely relying on
forecasts submitted on the day the question is called, proves advantageous for both baselines and all
The number of instances corresponds to the total number of days all questions were open. Both
simple baselines and a neural network are employed, considering both (a) daily forecasts and (b)
active forecasts submitted up to ten days prior.
The questions are divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Subsequently, all forecasts
submitted throughout the duration of each question are assigned to their respective subsets. Itâ€™s
important to note that randomly splitting the forecasts would be an inappropriate approach. This is
because forecasts for the same question submitted on different days would be distributed across the
training, validation, and test subsets, leading to data leakage and inaccurate performance evaluation.
4.1 Baselines
Two unsupervised baselines are considered.credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do
not require tracking individual forecasters.
