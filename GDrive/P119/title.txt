LetX⊆RD. The forward process is a Gauss-Markov process with transition densities defined as
q(xt|xt−1) =N(xt;√αtxt−1,(1−αt)I),
where α1, . . . , α Tis a fixed noise schedule such that 0< αt<1for all t. This definition implies that at each time step 1≤t≤T,

 Given that general non-monotone operators may display erratic behavior, such as periodic cycles and
spurious attractors, it is reasonable to seek settings that extend the monotone framework while remaining manageable. First and
foremost is the extensively studied setting of ν-weak monotonicity:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥ − ν∥u−v∥2.
Such operators arise as the gradients of the well-studied class of weakly convex functions, a rather general class of functions as it
includes all functions without upward cusps. In particular, every smooth function with a Lipschitz gradient turns out to fulfill this
property.
