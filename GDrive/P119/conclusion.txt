 It was noted that the convergence proof for the golden ratio algorithm (GRAAL) is valid without any changes. While
the assumption that a Minty solution exists is a generalization of the monotone setting, it is challenging to find non-monotone
problems that possess such solutions. In our setting, as per Assumption 1, the Minty inequality (MVI) can be violated at any point
by a factor proportional to the squared operator norm.
Negative comonotonicity. Although previously studied under the term "cohypomonotonicity," the concept of negative comono-
tonicity has recently been explored. On the other hand, extending the notion of cocoercivity to allow for negative coefficients, referred to as cohypomonotonicity,
has received much less attention and is given by:
⟨F(u)−F(v), u−v⟩ ≥ − γ∥F(u)−F(v)∥2.
Clearly, if a Stampacchia solution exists for such an operator, then it also fulfills Assumption 1.
Behavior with respect to the solution. While the above properties are standard assumptions in the literature, it is usually sufficient
to require the corresponding condition to hold when one of the arguments is a (Stampacchia) solution. This means that instead of

A small Sub-Gaussian metric between random variables indicates that their values are likely to be
close. To capture the Sub-Gaussian structure of a process, we introduce ε-nets in the Sub-Gaussian
metric. For a given ε >0, these are subsets  ̄Q⊆ ̄Psuch that for every  ̄p∈ ̄P, there is a  ̄q∈ ̄Q
satisfying
