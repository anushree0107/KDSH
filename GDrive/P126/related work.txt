concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the
relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).

Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound
relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For
instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.
Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,
predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center
 A strong justification for a forecast can be considered a well-reasoned supporting argument.
Previous work in this area includes identifying argument components such as claims, premises,
backing, rebuttals, and refutations, as well as mining arguments that support or oppose a particular
claim. Despite these efforts, it was found that crowdsourced justifications rarely adhere to these
established argumentation frameworks, even though such justifications are valuable for aggregating
forecasts.
Finally, several studies have focused on forecasting using datasets similar or identical to the one used
in this research. From a psychological perspective, researchers have explored strategies for enhancing
forecasting accuracy, such as utilizing top-performing forecasters (often called "superforecasters"),
observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
