 However, since
these improvements are relatively minor, we further analyze the results to understand if and how TL
and MTL are beneficial.
7 Results Analysis
This section provides a detailed analysis of the modelsâ€™ performance, drawing on insights from the
dataset and the classification errors made by the models. The discussion in the following sections is
primarily based on the results from the test split, as it is larger than the development split.
7.1 Relation Distribution
To illustrate the complexity of the task, we depict the distribution of the most frequent relations in
NomBank and PCEDT across the three data splits in Figure 1. Notably, approximately 71.18% of the
highly skewed dataset, compared to a robust single-task learning baseline. 2. Although our research
concentrates on TL and MTL, we present, to our knowledge, the first experimental results on the
relatively recent dataset from Fares (2016).

Approaches to interpreting noun-noun compounds differ based on the classification of compound
relations, as well as the machine learning models and features employed to learn these relations. For
instance, some define a broad set of relations, while others employ a more detailed classification.
Some researchers challenge the idea that noun-noun compounds can be interpreted using a fixed,
predetermined set of relations, proposing alternative methods based on paraphrasing. We center
Broader Impact
Supervised machine learning now affects both personal and public lives significantly. Generalization is
critical to the reliability and safety of empirically trained models. Our analysis aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the relationships between generalization, architectural design, and available data.
We have discussed the concepts and demonstrated the effectiveness of using uniform concentration
events for generalization guarantees of common supervised machine learning algorithms.
