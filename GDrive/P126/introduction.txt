A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of the
domain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that
TL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relations
within a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularly
well-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when applied
to the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in a
observed on the ’most challenging’ inputs that include at least one constituent that was not present in
the training data. However, clear indications of ’lexical memorization’ effects are evident in our error
analysis of unseen compounds.
Typically, the transfer of representations or sharing between tasks is more effective at the embedding
layers, which represent the model’s internal representation of the compound constituents. Furthermore,
in multi-task learning, the complete sharing of model architecture across tasks degrades its capacity
to generalize when it comes to less frequent relations.
The dataset provided by Fares (2016) is an appealing resource for new neural approaches to compound
interpretation because it links this sub-problem with broad-coverage semantic role labeling or
Table 9 shows that Transfer Learning (TL) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approaches reduce
generalization error in NomBank across all scenarios, with the exception of TLH and TLEH for
completely unseen compounds, where error increases. The greatest error reductions are achieved
by MTL models across all three types of unseen compounds. Specifically, MTLE reduces the error
by approximately six points for compounds with unseen right constituents and by eleven points for
fully unseen compounds. Moreover, MTLF reduces the error by five points when the left constituent
is unseen. It’s important to interpret these results in conjunction with the Count row in Table 9 for
a comprehensive view.
