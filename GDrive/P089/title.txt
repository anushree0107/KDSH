a common aspect of the aforementioned studies is that their bounds are contingent on the error of the score estimator. According to
some, providing precise guarantees for the estimation of the score function is challenging, as it necessitates an understanding of the
non-convex training dynamics of neural network optimization, which is currently beyond reach. Therefore, upper bounds are derived
without making assumptions about the learned score function. Instead, the bound presented here is dependent on a reconstruction
loss calculated over a finite independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample. Intuitively, a loss function is defined, which
quantifies the average Euclidean distance between a sample from the data-generating distribution and the reconstruction obtained by
 Intuitively, the difference between πθ(·|xi
0)andπθ(·)
is determined by the corresponding initial distributions: q(xT|xi
0)andp(xT)forπθ(·). Hence, if the two initial distributions are
close, and if the steps of the backward process are smooth (see Assumption 1), then πθ(·|xi
0)andπθ(·)are close to each other.

3.1 Theorem Statement
We are now ready to present the main result: a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the data-generating
distribution μand the learned distribution πθ(·).
 Inspired by utilizing multihead self-attention, we utilize our DCSA with various kernel lengths with the same
aim: allowing asymmetric long-term learning. The multihead DCSA takes in two inputs ˆx1,ˆx2∈RN×dand yields:
