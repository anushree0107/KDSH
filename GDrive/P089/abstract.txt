a common aspect of the aforementioned studies is that their bounds are contingent on the error of the score estimator. According to
some, providing precise guarantees for the estimation of the score function is challenging, as it necessitates an understanding of the
non-convex training dynamics of neural network optimization, which is currently beyond reach. Therefore, upper bounds are derived
without making assumptions about the learned score function. Instead, the bound presented here is dependent on a reconstruction
loss calculated over a finite independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample. Intuitively, a loss function is defined, which
quantifies the average Euclidean distance between a sample from the data-generating distribution and the reconstruction obtained by
 Inspired by utilizing multihead self-attention, we utilize our DCSA with various kernel lengths with the same
aim: allowing asymmetric long-term learning. The multihead DCSA takes in two inputs ˆx1,ˆx2∈RN×dand yields:
MDCSA k1,...,k n(ˆx1,ˆx2) = Ξ n(φk1,...,k n(ˆx1,ˆx2)) (4)

 We prove this property in a network
recovery setting in Theorem 2, and also an agnostic learning setting in Theorem 3. These results
ensure a small generalization error, when any optimization algorithm finds a network with a small
empirical risk. We develop the key proof techniques for deriving the sample complexity of achieving
NeuRIPs in Section V , by using the chaining theory of stochastic processes. The derived results are
summarized in Section VI, where we also explore potential future research directions.
