 Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of
each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.
4.3 Architecture Ablation
Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:

* Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction and
the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the
three elements: (a) a binary flag indicating whether the forecast was submitted on the day the question
is being called or on a previous day, (b) the prediction itself (a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0),
and (c) a representation of the justification. The representation of the justification is also obtained
using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout.
The LSTM has a hidden state with a dimensionality of 256 and processes the sequence of forecasts
as its input. During the tuning process, it was discovered that providing the representation of the
question alongside each forecast is more effective than processing forecasts independently of the
question. - A modified transformer
encoder in combination with a CRF layer representing a model with the capability to capture global dependency and enforce
dependencies in temporal aspects. - A state-of-the-art model for multimodal and multivariate time series with a transformer encoder
to learn asymmetric correlations across modalities. - An alternative to the previous model, representing it with a GRN layer replacing
the context aggregation layer and a CRF layer added as the last layer. - MDCSA1,4,7 4APS, as an ablation study, with our proposed
