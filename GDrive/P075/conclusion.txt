A key reason for utilizing multi-task learning is to enhance generalization by making use of the
domain-specific details present in the training data of related tasks. In this study, we demonstrate that
TL and MTL can serve as a form of regularization, enabling the prediction of infrequent relations
within a dataset marked by a highly skewed distribution of relations. This dataset is particularly
well-suited for TL and MTL experimentation, as elaborated in Section 3.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
1. Through meticulous analysis of results, we discover that TL and MTL, especially when applied
to the embedding layer, enhance overall accuracy and F1 scores for less frequent relations in a
 LSTMs performed worse than the
baseline, likely due to overfitting, whereas learning sub-events proved beneficial. Fastballs were the
easiest to detect (68% accuracy), followed by sliders (45%), while sinkers were the most difficult
(12%).
6.3 Continuous Video Activity Detection
We evaluate models extended for continuous videos using per-frame mean average precision (mAP),
with results shown in Table 8. This setting is more challenging than segmented videos, requiring
the model to identify activity start and end times and handle ambiguous negative examples. All
models improve upon the baseline per-frame classification, confirming the importance of temporal
information.an activity, eliminating the need for the model to identify the start and end of activities. Our methods
are based on a CNN that generates a per-frame or per-segment representation, derived from standard
two-stream CNNs using deep CNNs like I3D or InceptionV3.
Given video features vof dimensions T×D, where Trepresents the video’s temporal length and D
is the feature’s dimensionality, the usual approach for feature pooling involves max- or mean-pooling
across the temporal dimension, followed by a fully-connected layer for video clip classification, as
depicted in Fig. 5(a). This approach, however, yields a single representation for the entire video,
losing temporal information.
