We define our networks and perform parameter optimization using PyTorch. We optimize the
parameters of both the unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss
function, guiding the network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from
the look-up tables. Each dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split, with a random seed of 0. The
optimizer is ADAM, with a learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and the number of training
epochs is 500.

was computed and clipped to [âˆ’20,20]. For InceptionV3, features were computed every 3 frames
(8 fps), while for I3D, every frame was used, with I3D having a temporal stride of 8, resulting in
3 features per second (3 fps). Models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using the Adam
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, decayed by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, for a total of 50
epochs.

6.2 Segmented Video Activity Recognition
We initially conducted binary pitch/non-pitch classification for each video segment. This task is
sequential processing of video features, whereas other methods can be fully parallelized.
