are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the modelâ€™s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
Mbacke et al. (2023), and the proofs presented are fundamental.
1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.Deep Learning Approaches utilize neural networks trained on large image datasets for portion
estimation. Regression networks estimate the energy value of food from single images or from an
"Energy Distribution Map" that maps input images to energy distributions. Some networks use both
images and depth maps to estimate energy, mass, and macronutrient content. However, deep learning
methods require extensive data for training and are not always interpretable, with performance
degrading when test images significantly differ from training data.
While these methods have advanced food portion estimation, they face limitations that hinder their
widespread use and accuracy. Stereo-based methods are impractical for single images, model-based
