are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the model’s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL

1 Introduction
Diffusion models, alongside generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders (V AEs), are among the most influential
families of deep generative models. These models have demonstrated remarkable empirical results in generating images and audio,
as well as in various other applications.
Two primary methods exist for diffusion models: denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and score-based generative
models (SGMs). DDPMs incrementally convert samples from the desired distribution into noise via a forward process, while
simultaneously training a backward process to reverse this transformation, enabling the creation of new samples.• a standard neural network architecture gb:X→Rm,
and then defining Gb(x;θb) =hb(gb(x;θb)).
The framework proposed here does not require an entirely separate network for each b. In many
applications, it may be advantageous for the constrained predictors to share earlier layers, thus
creating a shared representation of the input space. In addition, our definition of the safe predictor is
general and is not limited to neural networks.
In Appendix B, we show examples of applying our approach to synthetic datasets in 2-D and 3-D
with simple neural networks. These examples show that our safe predictor can enforce arbitrary
input-output specifications using convex output constraints on neural networks, and that the learned
