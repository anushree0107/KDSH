7 Conclusion
This report examines and compiles the techniques and findings from the MetaFood Workshop
challenge on 3D Food Reconstruction. The challenge sought to enhance 3D reconstruction methods
by concentrating on food items, tackling the distinct difficulties presented by varied textures, reflective
The dataset for the MetaFood Challenge features 20 carefully chosen food items from the MetaFood3D
dataset, each scanned in 3D and accompanied by video recordings. To ensure precise size accuracy
in the reconstructed 3D models, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern
mat, serving as physical scaling references. The challenge is divided into three levels of difficulty,
determined by the quantity of 2D images provided for reconstruction:
• Easy: Around 200 images taken from video.
• Medium: 30 images.
• Hard: A single image from a top-down perspective.
Table 1 details the food items included in the dataset.
