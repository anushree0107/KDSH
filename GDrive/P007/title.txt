semantic dependency parsing in PCEDT and NomBank. Future research will focus on incorporating
additional natural language processing tasks defined using these frameworks to understand noun-noun
compound interpretation using TL and MTL.

this task is influenced by factors such as the label set used and its distribution. For the experiments
detailed in this paper, we utilize a noun-noun compounds dataset that features compounds annotated
with two distinct taxonomies of relations. This means that each noun-noun compound is associated
with two different relations, each based on different linguistic theories. This dataset is derived from
established linguistic resources, including NomBank and the Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank 2.0 (PCEDT). We chose this dataset for two primary reasons: firstly, the dual annotation of
relations on the same set of compounds is ideal for exploring TL and MTL approaches; secondly,
To better comprehend lexical memorizationâ€™s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each

relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
