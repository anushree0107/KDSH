In parallel, the team uses a tool called SAM for reference object segmentation. SAM segments
the reference object with a user-provided prompt, producing a reference object mask MRfor each
keyframe. This mask helps track the reference object across all frames. The XMem++ method
extends the reference object mask MRto all frames, creating a comprehensive set of reference object
masks {MR

i=1.{Rf, Rr}for the reference and food objects, providing detailed 3D representations. The team uses the
"Remove Isolated Pieces" technique to refine the meshes. Given that the scenes contain only one food
item, the diameter threshold is set to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes isolated connected
components with diameters less than or equal to 5%, resulting in a cleaned mesh {RCf, RCr}. This
step ensures that only significant parts of the mesh are retained.
The team manually identifies an initial scaling factor Susing the reference mesh via MeshLab. This
factor is fine-tuned to Sfusing depth information and food and reference masks, ensuring accurate
To better comprehend lexical memorization’s impact, we present the ratio of relation-specific con-
stituents in both NomBank and PCEDT, as depicted in Figure 2. We define a relation-specific
constituent as a left or right constituent that appears with only one specific relation within the training
data. Its ratio is calculated as its proportion in the full set of left or right constituents for each

relation. Analyzing Figure 2 reveals that NomBank relations possess higher ratios of relation-specific
constituents compared to PCEDT. This potentially makes learning the former easier if the model
solely relies on lexical memorization. Additionally, ARGM-TMP in NomBank and TWHEN in
