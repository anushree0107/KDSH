convolution appear to overfit. Convolutional sub-events, especially when combined with super-event
representation, significantly enhance performance, particularly for frame-based features.
 This provides a common learned representation of the input space,
while allowing each predictor to adapt to its own constraints. After the shared layers, each constrained
predictor has an additional two hidden layers and their final outputs are projected onto our convex
approximation of the safe region of the output space, using Gb(x) = min jGj(x). In our experiments,
we set ε= 0.0001 .
With this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability
constraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and 2880,
respectively. Our safe predictor is orders of magnitude smaller than the original look-up tables.

are updated during the training of all models. We utilize the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam)
optimization function across all models, with a learning rate set to 0.001. The loss function employed
is the negative-log likelihood. A Sigmoid activation function is used for the units in the hidden layer.
All models are trained with mini-batches of size five. The maximum number of epochs is capped
at 50, but an early stopping criterion based on the model’s accuracy on the validation split is also
implemented. This means that training is halted if the validation accuracy does not improve over five
consecutive epochs. All models are implemented in Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend. The TL
