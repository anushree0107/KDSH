Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions
and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,
empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current studyâ€™s focus,
researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within
online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including
within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.
The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,
without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.
Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-
tation.79%, and 82.89% in NDCG@20 on the
Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book datasets, respectively. Compared to the strongest baselines, PAAC delivers better
performance. The most significant improvements are observed on Yelp2018, where our model achieves an 8.70% increase
in Recall@20, a 10.81% increase in HR@20, and a 30.2% increase in NDCG@20. This improvement can be attributed
to our use of popularity-aware supervised alignment to enhance the representation of less popular items and re-weighted
contrastive learning to address representation separation from a popularity-centric perspective.
 Besides differing in the NLP tasks they investigate, the aforementioned
studies employ slightly varied definitions of TL and MTL. Our research aligns with certain studies in
that we apply TL and MTL to learn different semantic annotations of noun-noun compounds using
the same dataset. However, our experimental design is more akin to other work in that we experiment
with initializing parameters across all layers of the neural network and concurrently train a single
MTL model on two sets of relations.
3 Task Definition and Dataset
The objective of this task is to train a model to categorize the semantic relationships between pairs
of nouns in a labeled dataset, where each pair forms a noun-noun compound. The complexity of
