4 First Place Team - VolETA
4.1 Methodology
The team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and calculate
precise food volumes.
4.1.1 Overview
The team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume
from RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection ensures data quality, supported by perceptual
hashing and blur detection. Camera pose estimation and object segmentation pave the way for neural
surface reconstruction, creating detailed meshes for volume estimation. Refinement steps, including
applicability.
•Complex backgrounds and objects: The method has not been tested in environments with
complex backgrounds or highly intricate food objects.
•Capturing complexities: The method has not been evaluated under different capturing
complexities, such as varying distances and camera speeds.
•Pipeline complexity: For one-shot neural rendering, the team currently uses One-2-3-45.
They aim to use only the 2D diffusion model, Zero123, to reduce complexity and improve
efficiency.
