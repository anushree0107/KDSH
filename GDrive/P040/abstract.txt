 We also experiment with combining the super- and sub-event representations
to form a three-level hierarchy for event representation.

6.1 Implementation Details
For our base per-segment CNN, we utilize the I3D network, pre-trained on the ImageNet and Kinetics
datasets. I3D has achieved state-of-the-art performance on segmented video tasks, providing a reliable
feature representation. We also employ a two-stream version of InceptionV3, pre-trained on Imagenet
and Kinetics, as our base per-frame CNN for comparison. InceptionV3 was chosen for its depth
compared to previous two-stream CNNs. Frames were extracted at 25 fps, and TVL1 optical flow
L/2,L/4, and L/8, resulting in 14 segments per window. Max-pooling is applied to each segment,
and the pooled features are concatenated, yielding a 14×D-dimensional representation for each
window, which is then used as input to the classifier.
For temporal convolutional models in continuous videos, we modify the segmented video approach by
learning a temporal convolutional kernel of length Land convolving it with the input video features.
This operation transforms input of size T×Dinto output of size T×D, followed by a per-frame
classifier. This enables the model to aggregate local temporal information.
 Utilizing the 60fps rate available in YouTube videos, we
recalculated optical flow and extracted RGB frames at this higher rate. Employing a fully-connected
layer with a single output for pitch speed prediction and minimizing the L1 loss between predicted
and actual speeds, we achieved an average error of 3.6mph. Table 6 compares different models, and
Fig. 8 illustrates the sub-events learned for various speeds.
