 The MDCSA network has all the capabilities that the state-of-the-art model has,
with an improvement in suppressing the accelerometer modality when needed via the GRN layer embedded in DCSA. Suppressing
the noisy modality seems to have a strong impact on maintaining the performance of the network when the training data is limited.
This is validated by how the alternative to the state-of-the-art model (i.e., the state-of-the-art model with added GRN and CRF
layers) outperforms the standard state-of-the-art model by an average of 2.2% for the F1-score in the 4m-HC and 4m-PD validations.
the RSSI signals, in particular to help distinguish adjacent rooms, which RSSI-only systems typically struggle with. If it will, how
can we incorporate these extra features (and modalities) into the existing features for accurate room predictions, particularly in the
context of PD where the acceleration signal may be significantly impacted by the disease itself?
(2) Modeling local and global temporal dynamics. The true correlations between inputs both intra-modality (i.e., RSSI signal among
access points) and inter-modality (i.e., RSSI signal against accelerometer fluctuation) are dynamic. These dynamics can affect one
another within a local context (e.g., cyclical patterns) or across long-term relationships.and accelerometry traces in six spatial directions (corresponding to the three spatial directions (x, y, z) for each wearable) were
recorded at each time point. The accelerometer data is resampled to 5Hz to synchronize the data with RSSI values. With a 5-second
time window and a 5Hz sampling rate, each RSSI data sample has an input of size (25 x 20), and accelerometer data has an input of
size (25 x 6). Imputation for missing values, specifically for RSSI data, is applied by replacing the missing values with a value that is
not possible normally (i.e., -120dB).
