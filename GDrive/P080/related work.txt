reveals three primary themes: elections (including terms like "voting," "winners," and "candidate"),
government actions (including terms like "negotiations," "announcements," "meetings," and "passing
(a law)"), and wars and violent crimes (including terms like "groups," "killing," "civilian (casualties),"
and "arms"). Although not explicitly represented in the LDA topics, the questions address both
domestic and international events within these broad themes.

readability scores indicate that most justifications are easily understood by high school students (11th
 However, since
these improvements are relatively minor, we further analyze the results to understand if and how TL
and MTL are beneficial.
7 Results Analysis
This section provides a detailed analysis of the models’ performance, drawing on insights from the
dataset and the classification errors made by the models. The discussion in the following sections is
primarily based on the results from the test split, as it is larger than the development split.
7.1 Relation Distribution
To illustrate the complexity of the task, we depict the distribution of the most frequent relations in
NomBank and PCEDT across the three data splits in Figure 1. Notably, approximately 71.18% of the
26% of right constituents of compounds annotated as AIM occur
in other compounds annotated as RSTR. This explains the models’ inability to learn AIM but raises
questions about their ability to learn relational representations, which we explore further in Section
7.3.
