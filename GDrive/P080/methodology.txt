three elements: (a) a binary flag indicating whether the forecast was submitted on the day the question
is being called or on a previous day, (b) the prediction itself (a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0),
and (c) a representation of the justification. The representation of the justification is also obtained
using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout.
The LSTM has a hidden state with a dimensionality of 256 and processes the sequence of forecasts
as its input. During the tuning process, it was discovered that providing the representation of the
question alongside each forecast is more effective than processing forecasts independently of the
question. the best baseline (the
relative improvements are denoted as Imp.).

compare PAAC with several debiased baselines, including re-weighting-based models, decorrelation-based models, and contrastive
learning-based models.
We utilize three widely used metrics, namely Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K, to evaluate the performance of Top-K recommen-
dation. Recall@K and HR@K assess the number of target items retrieved in the recommendation results, emphasizing coverage. In
contrast, NDCG@K evaluates the positions of target items in the ranking list, with a focus on their positions in the list. We use
