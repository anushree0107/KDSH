Summary of Reviews:
Accepted Paper Review (ScaleGMN):
● Summary: This work introduces ScaleGMNs, GNN-based metanetworks that extend permutation equivariance to account for scaling symmetries in input neural networks' parameters.

○ Excellent writing and clear theoretical setup.
○ Strong theoretical results supporting scaling equivariances and expressive power.
○ Significant empirical improvements, particularly in INR classification, without reliance on unfair optimization tricks.
○ Interesting findings, such as the bidirectional version's varied performance and robustness without additional features.
● Weaknesses:
○ Limited scope of experimental tasks, lacking tests on equivariant tasks like INR editing.
○ Some inconsistencies in describing ScaleInv equations and canonicalization approaches.
● Rating: 8 (Strong Accept).
● Confidence: 4 (High confidence).

Rejected Paper Review:
The paper introduces a greedy search-and-score algorithm for causal structure discovery in ancestral graphs, accommodating directed and bidirected edges. It decomposes the likelihood function into multivariate cross-information over ac-connected components, building on prior head-and-tail factorization work. The authors claim this approach provides a novel theoretical foundation for causal graph discovery and demonstrate its application through experimental evaluations.
Key Strengths
1. Algorithm Development:
○ Novel empirical algorithm motivated by theoretical decomposition of the likelihood function.
○ Scalable to graphs with several dozen vertices and links.
2. Experimental Validation:
○ Tested on synthetic datasets and bnlearn benchmarks.
○ Demonstrates higher precision and comparable recall to the MIIC algorithm.
Key Weaknesses
1. Lack of Theoretical Guarantees:
○ No convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithm.
○ Algorithm relies heavily on MIIC and lacks independence from its base.
2. Sensitivity to Noise:
○ Multivariate cross-information may be highly sensitive to noise, particularly with large variable sets.
3. Novelty Concerns:
○ Theorem 1 is equivalent to a decomposition from prior work, questioning its originality.
4. Limited Explanation:
○ Insufficient clarity on how Theorem 1 directly informs the proposed algorithm.
