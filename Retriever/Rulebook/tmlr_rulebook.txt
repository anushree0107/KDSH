Review of "Addressing Min-Max Challenges in Nonconvex-Nonconcave
Problems with Solutions Exhibiting Weak Minty Properties"
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The introduction of weak Minty solutions and their application
to nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems extends existing monotonicity
concepts, offering new insights into challenging optimization scenarios.
2. Methodological Innovation: Proposes OGDA+ and an adaptive step-size
variant of EG+, achieving convergence rates comparable to or better than
traditional methods like extragradient (EG).
3. Practical Relevance: Adaptive step-size EG+ removes the dependency on the
Lipschitz constant, making it more versatile for real-world problems with varying
curvature.
4. Robust Experiments: The inclusion of numerical experiments (e.g., von
Neumann’s ratio game, "Forsaken," and lower bound examples) validates the
theoretical results and demonstrates the utility of the proposed methods.
Weaknesses:
1. Limited Generality: While weak Minty solutions broaden the scope of solvable
problems, the paper lacks a detailed discussion on their applicability across
various domains beyond theoretical cases.
2. Complexity of Analysis: The mathematical framework, particularly around
step-size constraints and adaptive methods, may be challenging for readers
without a strong background in variational inequalities.
3. Scalability Concerns: The practical implementation of adaptive methods in
large-scale or high-dimensional settings remains unclear.
Questions:
1. How do weak Minty solutions compare to other generalizations of monotonicity in
terms of practical problem applicability?
2. Are there scenarios where OGDA+ provides a clear advantage over EG+ beyond
the specific lower bound example?

3. What are the computational trade-offs of adaptive step-size EG+ versus
backtracking methods?
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide more examples of real-world applications where weak Minty solutions
and the proposed methods are beneficial.
2. Simplify the explanation of theoretical concepts like step-size constraints and
parameter tuning for broader accessibility.
3. Explore scalability and efficiency of adaptive step-size methods in
high-dimensional optimization problems.
Minor Issues:
● Clarify the role of the parameter γ\gammaγ in OGDA+ and how it affects
convergence rates.
● Improve figures to highlight key experimental results more effectively.
● Discuss limitations of weak Minty solutions in greater depth.

Review of "Examining the Convergence of Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models: A Quantitative Analysis"
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: Provides a quantitative upper bound on the Wasserstein
distance for diffusion models without relying on restrictive assumptions or
exponential dependencies.
2. Theoretical Rigor: Avoids relying on the learned score function or SDE toolkit,
offering a robust alternative with straightforward proofs.
3. Practical Implications: Demonstrates applicability across various
data-generating distributions, even those lacking density relative to the Lebesgue
measure.
Weaknesses:
1. Complexity: Dense mathematical framework might limit accessibility for readers
unfamiliar with Wasserstein metrics or diffusion models.

2. Empirical Validation: Limited experimental results to illustrate real-world
applicability of the theoretical bounds.
Suggestions:
1. Include intuitive explanations or visualizations to enhance accessibility.
2. Expand on empirical evaluation, showcasing benefits for practical applications
like image generation.
Overall Assessment:
A solid theoretical contribution that strengthens the understanding of diffusion model
convergence. Improved accessibility and practical validation would enhance its impact.
