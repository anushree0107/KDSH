Review of "Detecting Medication Usage in Parkinson’s Disease Through Multi-modal
Indoor Positioning: A Pilot Study in a Naturalistic Environment"
Strengths:
1. Novel Contribution: The study introduces the MDCSA model, leveraging RSSI and
accelerometer data for indoor localization, and applies it to monitor Parkinson's disease
(PD) symptoms, a unique and impactful application.
2. Real-World Dataset: Data collected from smart homes with PD and healthy control
participants provides ecological validity, emphasizing naturalistic and free-living
conditions.
3. Innovative Framework: The integration of multi-modal data with the MDCSA model
effectively captures temporal dynamics and reduces noise, improving room-level
localization and medication state classification.
4. Clinical Relevance: The use of in-home gait speed features for detecting medication
states highlights practical implications for monitoring PD progression and aiding clinical
decision-making.
Weaknesses:
1. Sample Size: The small participant cohort limits the generalizability of findings and
statistical robustness.
2. Model Transferability: The MDCSA model’s performance may vary in diverse home
layouts, necessitating additional pre-training for new environments.
3. Limited Feature Exploration: Only a subset of gait speed features is used for
medication state prediction; exploring additional features may enhance accuracy.
Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Validate the model on larger, more diverse cohorts to improve generalizability.
2. Address transferability challenges by testing the model in varied home layouts and
conditions.
3. Explore additional features and alternative sensor modalities to enrich medication state
predictions.
Minor Issues:
● Provide detailed visualizations of room-to-room transitions for clearer interpretation.
● Clarify the limitations of the accelerometer data in cases of severe PD symptoms.

Review of the Paper "Addressing Popularity Bias with
Popularity-Conscious Alignment and Contrastive Learning"
Strengths:
1. Novelty: The introduction of the Popularity-Aware Alignment and Contrast (PAAC)
method is innovative. It effectively addresses two key issues—insufficient representation
learning for unpopular items and representation separation caused by popularity bias.
2. Methodological Rigor: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the PAAC
framework, including the supervised alignment and re-weighted contrastive learning
modules. The inclusion of dynamic grouping and adjustable hyperparameters enhances
flexibility and applicability across different datasets.
3. Experimental Validation: The paper presents thorough experiments on three real-world
datasets (Amazon-Book, Yelp2018, Gowalla), with significant performance
improvements shown over various baselines.
4. Ablation Study: The ablation study clearly highlights the contributions of different
components of PAAC, demonstrating its effectiveness.
5. Comprehensive Evaluation: Metrics such as Recall@K, HR@K, and NDCG@K are
used, and the model’s performance across varying popularity item groups is analyzed.
Weaknesses:
1. Clarity of Mathematical Formulations: Some equations, particularly those for
re-weighted contrastive learning, lack intuitive explanations for non-expert readers.
Clarifying the underlying reasoning could improve understanding.
2. Limited Discussion on Hyperparameter Sensitivity: While the authors present
experiments on hyperparameters (α, β, λ1, λ2), a deeper discussion on the choice of
optimal values and their generalizability across datasets is missing.
3. Sparse Dataset Limitation: The model’s performance improvements on sparser
datasets like Gowalla are less pronounced. Further refinement for such datasets could
improve robustness.
Questions:
1. How does PAAC handle highly dynamic environments where item popularity changes
frequently?
2. Can the authors elaborate on potential extensions of PAAC to other types of biases
beyond popularity bias?
3. Have the authors considered alternative grouping strategies beyond binary
(popular/unpopular) to account for intermediate popularity levels?
Minor Suggestions:

● Figure Descriptions: Some figures lack detailed captions, making it difficult for readers
to interpret results at a glance.
● Typographical Issues: Minor typos and formatting inconsistencies, such as missing
spaces around certain symbols in equations, should be corrected.
● Line 13-16: The sentence structure is difficult to follow and could be revised for better
readability.
● Table Formatting: The presentation of tables could be improved by including clearer
labels for metrics and datasets.
